Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 13 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK]

Date: 14 March 2022 

From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation's armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 13 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 1,761 civilian casualties in the country: 636 killed and 1,125 injured. This included: 

- a total of 636 killed (127 men, 91 women, 6 girls, and 10 boys, as well as 30 children and 372 adults whose sex is yet unknown) 

- a total of 1,125 injured (101 men, 71 women, 15 girls, and 4 boys, as well as 43 children and 891 adults whose sex is yet unknown) 

 - In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 720 casualties (148 killed and 572 injured) 

         - On Government-controlled territory: 564 casualties (122 killed and 442 injured) 

         - On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed 'republics': 156 casualties (26 killed and 130 injured) 

 - In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,041 casualties (488 killed and 553 injured) 

Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes. 

OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Izium (Kharkiv region), and Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region) where there are allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics. 

OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 9 a.m. (local time) 14 March, 90 children had been killed and more than 100 injured. OHCHR also notes the report of the Head of the Investigative Department of the National Police of Kharkiv Region, according to which as of 6 p.m. (local time) 13 March, 212 civilians had been killed in the region.
