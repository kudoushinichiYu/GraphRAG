The Ministry has called on the international community to support the development and implementation of a Plan to protect and restore education in Ukraine.

More than one million school-age children have been forced to flee violence into neighboring countries, while the entire school and university age population is affected.

“We have been working intensively from the first day of the war. We cannot lose this entire generation of children,” said Arthur Seletskiy, Deputy Minister of Education and Science. “We are relaunching distance learning where security and safety enables. Our “Learning without Limits” project is enabling students to follow video classes. Resources for education are being diverted to our defense so we desperately need your financial support for education, learning materials and educational infrastructure.”

Dmytro Zavgorodnii, Head of the Ministry’s Digital Department explained that Ukraine boosted its  distance learning system during COVID-19 through the All-Ukrainian School Online platform, the Laptop for Every Teacher initiative and the Online University Admission. He requested support for expanding these to create additional contents for primary school; provide advanced training and additional laptops for school teachers, and an e-exam platform for university applicants.

“Education must be part of the humanitarian response - to provide psychosocial support, protection, kinship and opportunities to keep learning in these dramatic times,” said Stefania Giannini, UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Education. “Ukraine’s impressive range of remote learning platforms is a basis for building resilience. UNESCO’s Global Education Coalition can be leveraged to expand online learning platforms in Ukraine and refugee-hosting countries; to support teachers; make available learning contents and provide online socio-emotional support to help students and teachers.”
