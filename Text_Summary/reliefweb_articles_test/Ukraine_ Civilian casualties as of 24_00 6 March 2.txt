Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 6 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK]

From 4 am on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 12 midnight on 6 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 1,207 civilian casualties in the country: 406 killed and 801 injured. This included:

- a total of 406 killed (77 men, 45 women, 8 boys, and 4 girls, as well as 15 children and 257 adults whose sex is yet unknown)

- a total of 801 injured (72 men, 51 women, 11 girls, and 2 boys, as well as 29 children and 636 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 528 casualties (93 killed and 435 injured)     
 On Government-controlled territory: 394 casualties (70 killed and 324 injured)     
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 134 casualties (23 killed and 111 injured) o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 679 casualties (313 killed and 366 injured)  

Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes.  

OHCHR believes that the real figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, the town of Volnovakha where there are allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics.  

OHCHR notes the report of the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, according to which as of 12 am (local time) 6 March, 38 children had been killed and 71 injured. OHCHR also notes a report by the National Police of Kharkiv region, according to which as of 9 am (local time) 7 March, the total number of civilian casualties in Kharkiv region was 133 killed (128 adults and 5 children) and 319 injured.
