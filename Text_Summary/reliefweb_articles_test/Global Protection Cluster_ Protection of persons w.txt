Global Protection Cluster: Protection of persons with disabilities in Ukraine, March 8, 2022

In the current protection crisis unfolding in Ukraine, humanitarian actors must pay particular attention to those who are most at risk of threats to safety and rights violations â€“ including women, children, older people, and people who are blind and/or deaf, persons with psychosocial and intellectual disabilities, those who have mobility limitations, and persons with high support needs.

The Global Protection Cluster calls on all parties to the conflict and humanitarian actors to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in Ukraine, in accordance with:   
-   Their obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in particular Article 11 on situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies.   
-   The UN Security Council Resolution 2475 (2019) on Protection of Persons with Disabilities in Conflict.   
-   International Humanitarian Law and the Humanitarian Principles.
