Humanitarian Crisis in Ukraine: Scaling Up Our Support

At the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, we aim to relieve human suffering in war and disaster by conducting interdisciplinary, practice-based research and education that can be used by scholars, policymakers, NGOs, and others to foster interdisciplinary collaboration. Russia's aggression in Ukraine has severely undermined the concept of sovereignty and has led to escalating human rights violations. We join the international community in condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and express unwavering support to the people of Ukraine. We urge our community to unite for peace and act with compassion.

HHI has been working in Eastern Ukraine for the past few years as the Russian-Ukraine border conflict intensified, and we have scaled up our support of organizations in Ukraine, particularly in real-time training and operational support. Here is a list of our efforts so far:

**Clinical**

-   [**Morgan Broccoli**](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/190709)**, MD (BWH Emergency Medicine***)* flew to Poland on Feb 28 and was deployed to the Ukraine border as part of a WHO Emergency Medical Team to conduct needs assessments and support the health response strategy at the border.

-   [**Erica Nelson**](https://hhi.harvard.edu/people/erica-nelson)**, ****MD, PhM, MAS (BWH EM) **will be following her shortly in her role with [Team Rubicon](https://teamrubiconusa.org/).

-   [**Dan Schnorr**](https://hhi.harvard.edu/people/dan-schnorr-md)**, MD **deployed to Ukraine on March 6 with Doctors Without Borders [MSF](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/).

-   **WHO ****Emergency Training Programs** to train emergency medical teams through collaborations with BWH and our clinical partners. We are gathering medical supplies to create training packs for medical responders with a plan for field training in 8 to 10 oblasts and then operational guidance.

**Education**

- HHI taught a WHO Basic Emergency Care course in Dnipro. **HHI is working with the WHO to provide:**
   
1.  Russian and Ukrainian translation of Basic Emergency Care (BEC) for just-in-time training

2.  Setting up virtual training sessions for both Basic Emergency Care and for Stop the Bleed in Ukraine in partnership with the WHO and Ukrainian-American EM physicians

3.  Providing key equipment lists to partners in Ukraine for provision of emergency care

4.  Working with the WHO to rapidly develop and distribute a BEC in War module.
     
- **Humanitarian Negotiation Workshops focusing on Humanitarian Access in Eastern Ukraine:**Field Focus session on Humanitarian Access in Eastern Ukraine. The workshops aim to develop the professional skills of frontline leaders in negotiation, conflict resolution, and community engagement.

- **Curriculum development for the [Sviatogorsk group](https://www.sviatogorskgroup.com/en/)** in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine in a training and advisory capacity, to reconciliation and shape transitional justice for the people.
