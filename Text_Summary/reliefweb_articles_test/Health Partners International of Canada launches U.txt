Health Partners International of Canada launches Ukraine Response with first deployment of Emergency Humanitarian Medical Kits

OAKVILLE, ON, March 4, 2022 -- Today, Health Partners International of Canada (HPIC) launched its official response to Ukraine with a first shipment of Emergency Humanitarian Medical Kits from its Oakville Distribution Centre.

The first shipment is destined for the Medyka Crossing in Poland and will be transported by Canadian Medical Assistance Teams (CMAT), with additional shipments planned for the coming weeks. The Emergency Humanitarian Medical Kits contain basic but essential medicines such as antibiotics, antihypertensives, anti-inflammatories, analgesics and first aid.

"The Emergency Humanitarian Medical Kits will provide critical medical relief to families fleeing the war in Ukraine," says HPIC Interim President, Lois Brown. "We are grateful for CMAT's partnership in getting these medicines into the hands of Ukrainian people who have been forced from their homes. We will continue to do all we can to send relief to the people of Ukraine."

HPIC is currently working with more partners to identify the specialized medical needs of Ukrainians in-country and in bordering refugee settlements to prepare additional medical aid.
