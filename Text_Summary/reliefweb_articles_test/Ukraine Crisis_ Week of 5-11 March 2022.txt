Ukraine Crisis: Week of 5-11 March 2022

The Russian invasion of Ukraine entered its third week last week. Heavy fighting was reported in Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv, which were partially encircled by Russian troops ([Unian, 16 March 2022](https://www.unian.ua/war/viyna-v-ukrajini-zagiblih-civilnih-hovayut-u-bratskih-mogilah-naybilshe-v-mariupoli-novini-vtorgnennya-rosiji-v-ukrajinu-11745991.html)). Russian forces also surrounded Kherson, Melitopol city in the Zaporizhia region, and Mariupol in the Donetsk region, effectively cutting Ukraine off from the Azov Sea and linking Russian-controlled territories in Donbas and Crimea by land ([The Guardian, 3 March 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/kherson-russian-army-moves-to-cut-ukraine-access-to-sea)). 

Meanwhile, Russian forces continued to target civilians last week, deliberately shelling hospitals, kindergartens, and residential buildings, as well as firing at civilian evacuation routes from Mariupol, Volnovakha, and other cities ([The Guardian, 8 March 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/ukraine-war-civilians-sumy-irpin-refugees-russia)). Heavy Russian shelling of Mariupol was reported throughout the week.
