Briefing #1: Stateless people and people at risk of statelessness forcibly displaced from Ukraine (10 March 2022) [EN/PL/UK]

**1. Introduction**

The European Network on Statelessness (ENS) is a civil society alliance of over 170 organisations and individuals working to address statelessness in 41 European countries. This briefing explains why statelessness is important in the Ukraine refugee response; how to identify statelessness; access to protection for stateless people from Ukraine; where stateless people can get information; and makes recommendations to ensure routes to protection for stateless people from Ukraine.

Early reports from Ukraine and neighbouring countries suggest that stateless people fleeing the crisis in Ukraine may face additional barriers and differential treatment depending on their residence, nationality, and/or documentation status. It is imperative that European States ensure that this does not stop stateless people and those at risk of statelessness from accessing the same level of protection as currently offered to Ukrainian nationals.

**Numbers**

The last census in 2001 recorded 82,550 stateless people in Ukraine. In 2021, UNHCR estimated that 35,875 people in Ukraine were stateless or had ‘undetermined nationality’. However, only 6,047 stateless people were legally residing in Ukraine at the end of 2021. Approximately 10-20% of the estimated 400,000 Romani people living in Ukraine are stateless or at risk of statelessness. Additionally, 55% of children born in Donetsk and Luhansk and 88% of children born in Crimea were reported to lack Ukrainian birth certificates or personal documents, putting them at risk of statelessness.
