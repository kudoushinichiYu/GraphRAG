Ukraine: EU's first medical evacuation operation transfers Ukrainian children from Poland to Italy

On 13 March, the EU coordinated the first MEDEVAC operation by transferring 3 chronically ill paediatric patients from Poland to Italy. The operation was financially and operationally supported by the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and the EU’s Early Warning and Response System. The operation was carried out by an Italian medical team at the request of and in close cooperation with Poland. 

At the same time, the EU continues delivering emergency assistance to Ukraine. All 27 EU countries, plus Norway and Turkey, have offered help to Ukraine via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.

Between 6 and 12 March, over 1,900 tonnes of civil protection assistance have been shipped to Ukraine, including medical supplies, a mobile hospital, shelter items, clothes, foodstuffs, ambulances, and firefighting equipment.

Neighbouring countries Moldova, Poland, Slovakia, and most recently Czechia have also requested assistance via the Mechanism given the unprecedented number of people crossing the border. Several EU countries have responded by offering medicines, hygiene kits, power generators, and supplies to support accommodation needs.

Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, said: “As Ukraine has been torn into a war by Russia, millions of people have fled the country. The most vulnerable among the refugees are chronically ill patients who need urgent care and treatment. The EU has coordinated its first medical evacuation in Ukraine crisis to transfer 3 children and their relatives from Poland to Italy. We will continue working tirelessly so each Ukrainian refugee receives the medical care they need.”
