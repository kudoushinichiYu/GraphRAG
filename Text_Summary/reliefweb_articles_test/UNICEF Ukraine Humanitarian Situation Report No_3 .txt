**Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**

After eight years of conflict that was limited to eastern Ukraine, the sudden and dramatic escalation of war in Ukraine has resulted in hundreds of thousands of children and their families being internally displaced and fleeing to neighbouring countries looking for safety. OHCHR reports that 27 children have been killed, while 42 have been injured in the conflict, with numbers likely much higher as they reflect only what was able to be verified to date. Based on preliminary reports from the Ministry of Education (MoE), as of 7 March, at least 233 educational facilities across Ukraine have been damaged and destroyed. All education facilities across Ukraine are currently closed, impacting 5.7 million school-age children. The MoE is encouraging local authorities to resume education using distance learning modalities, wherever possible, starting from next week. At least 61 health care facilities have reportedly been destroyed in eight central, eastern, and northern areas of Ukraine. Transportation of children with medical conditions has also emerged as a key concern, with reports of two children having died on 7 March because it was impossible to transport them from local hospitals to the central children’s hospital in Kyiv. Children and their families are in desperate need of safety, stability, systematic protection services and psychosocial care. Displacement and conflict have harmed families’ livelihoods and economic opportunities, leaving many without sufficient income to meet their basic needs and unable to provide adequate support for their children. As the crisis escalates, UNICEF is scaling-up its humanitarian response in Ukraine to ensure sustained delivery of WASH, immunization and health care, education, child protection and humanitarian cash assistance.
