Ukraine: Massive, urgent response needed to meet soaring needs [EN/RU]

**The humanitarian situation in Ukraine is increasingly dire and desperate, and the ICRC is scaling up its response by the hour to meet people’s vast needs**

In just two weeks, homes have been reduced to rubble. Families are huddled underground for hours on end to seek refuge from fighting. Hundreds of thousands of people have no food, no water, no heat, no electricity and no medical care. Two million people are reported to have left their homes into neighbouring countries, while countless more are trapped and desperate for a safe escape.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been working in Ukraine since 2014 and continues to help those living through the conflict.

“Teams from the ICRC have been delivering medical supplies, food, water and hygiene material in Kyiv, Mariupol, Odessa, Donetsk, Luhansk, and many other places. But it’s clear much more must be done to assist the skyrocketing number of people in need. That’s why we are mobilizing more staff and supplies to Ukraine and neighbouring countries, to help people suffering from the effects of this conflict,” said Martin Schüepp, ICRC’s regional director for Europe and Central Asia.

Additional ICRC staff arrived in Ukraine this week to significantly scale up our work, including medical staff, weapons contamination specialists and other emergency team members. We are also sending teams to Hungary, Moldova, Poland Romania and Russia to support our regional response and coordinate with our partners from the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The ICRC is also setting up logistical hubs in neighbouring countries to more efficiently send relief items into Ukraine, with local supply chains broken down.

In addition to stepping up our operational response on the ground, we continue a sustained, bilateral and confidential dialogue with all sides on the conduct of hostilities as well as on the protection of the civilian population, reminding them of their obligations under international humanitarian law.
