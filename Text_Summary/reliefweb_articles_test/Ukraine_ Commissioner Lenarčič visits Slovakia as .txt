Ukraine: Commissioner Lenarčič visits Slovakia as EU continues emergency assistance

After almost 1 month of war in Ukraine, the EU maintains a steady flow of emergency aid to Ukraine and to countries receiving large numbers of refugees fleeing the Russian invasion. Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič is travelling to Slovakia to meet with the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Eduard Heger and to discuss the coordination of EU support to all those arriving from Ukraine.

The Commissioner will visit a new civil protection hub set up in Kosice that is now fully operational and is coordinating emergency assistance offered by 29 countries to Ukraine via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. In light of the large influx of people, Moldova, Poland, Slovakia and Czechia have also requested assistance via the Mechanism, and several EU countries have already offered shelter equipment, medical supplies, hygiene kits and power generators.

Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, said: “*It has been almost one month of this brutal war waged by Russia against Ukraine. This is one month of unnecessary human suffering, of lives lost, of families torn apart. In this month we have also witnessed the immense generosity of Europeans. I thank Slovakia which I am visiting today for its generous support to refugees. And our eagerness to help the people of Ukraine is as strong as ever. I want to thank each and every country in the EU, and also Norway and Turkey, as they have all extended their helping hand to deliver life-saving supplies to Ukraine through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. We are also stepping up our support to countries welcoming the refugees from Ukraine, namely Poland, Moldova, Slovakia and Czechia.”*
