PEPFAR Moves Swiftly to Ensure Life-Saving HIV Services Reach Ukraine

The United States government through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has moved decisively to ensure Ukrainians have continued access to life-saving HIV medications and services in this time of crisis.

PEPFAR has rapidly deployed an additional $6 million in emergency resources to procure significant tranches of anti-retroviral medications (ARVs) to support the over 100,000 people living with HIV that PEPFAR directly assists in Ukraine. Many people living with HIV are among the millions of Ukrainians who have been internally displaced in recent weeks, and PEPFAR is working to distribute the necessary medication to these individuals through various means. These medications are particularly vital as the delivery of ARVs purchased by the government of Ukraine have been disrupted by the conflict.

“PEPFAR stands firmly in solidarity with the Ukrainian people in this time of crisis,” said Dr. Angeli Achrekar, Acting U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy. “We have acted strongly and swiftly to ensure that Ukrainians living with HIV continue to have the life-saving HIV medications and prevention services they need.”

PEPFAR is working in lockstep across the U.S. government, with the government of Ukraine and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to deliver these life-saving HIV services and to continually assess the need for additional emergency procurement. PEPFAR and the Global Fund are also assisting Ukrainian refugees in neighboring countries to access ARVs and supporting HIV, tuberculosis, and other critical health services for military personnel and civilians injured in the fighting.

PEPFAR is a longstanding partner in Ukraine’s HIV response. Since 2007, PEPFAR has invested over $320 million to support life-saving HIV prevention and treatment services as well as health systems strengthening efforts in Ukraine.
