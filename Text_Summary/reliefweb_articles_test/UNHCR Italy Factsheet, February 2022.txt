Most arrivals were women and children (1,890 and 1,380, respectively). Many arrived from Slovenia and Austria via the Fernetti and Tarvisio border crossing points in the northern Friuli Venezia-Giulia region, travelling primarily by bus or private vehicles and intending to join relatives or friends in other locations across Italy. UNHCR staff was deployed to the Fernetti crossing point at the Italy-Slovenia border providing new arrivals with relevant information and contributing to the distribution of food and non-food items together with the authorities. Arrivals of Ukrainian citizens have continued unabated in the following weeks. A state of emergency was declared at the end of February until 31 December 2022, to provide relief and assistance to Ukrainians. On 28 February, a law decree was approved expanding reception capacity in both first-line and second-line facilities and providing that Ukrainians can access the 5,000 places in second-line facilities that had been reserved for persons evacuated from Afghanistan after the Talibans took power in August 2021. Since late February, UNHCR has been liaising with authorities, other UN agencies and civil society to coordinate the response to Ukrainian arrivals.
