Ukraine: FAO Humanitarian response update, 18 March 2022

- The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is extremely concerned about the effects of the war on lives and livelihoods in Ukraine. The war has already caused extensive loss of life and damage to infrastructure, and the situation remains extremely volatile, with likely significant impacts on food security and agricultural livelihoods.

- FAO is staying and delivering, and has reinforced its team in Ukraine, surging 12 staff – in addition to the 81 staff already in the country – to support the scale‐up, focusing on operations, cash programming, food security information, procurement, security, coordination, needs assessments and communications.

- About 10 percent of the USD 50 million requested by FAO under the Rapid Response Plan for Ukraine has been received to date. So far, funds received will enable FAO to assist 23 000 vulnerable rural men and women around Donetsk, Luhansk, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia. If more resources are made available now, FAO will be able to increase the number of rural people assisted this spring season.

- FAO has already started conducting needs assessments to access critical real‐time data on markets, input prices and availability, and on the impacts of the war on agriculture.

- FAO continues working closely with the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food to identify emerging needs and priority actions to safeguard rural livelihoods, and will continue to monitor the situation.

- FAO co-leads the Food Security and Livelihoods Cluster in Ukraine, which has been fully operational in eastern Ukraine since December 2014.
