CEB approves immediate support to IOM Slovakia for Ukrainian refugees and third-country nationals

**PARIS – The Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) has approved a € 150 000 grant from its Migrant and Refugee Fund (MRF) to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Slovakia to support incoming refugees and third country nationals from Ukraine.**

More than 2.3 million people have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries since 24 February 2022, including over 110,000 third-country nationals.

“At the time of unprecedented influx of people from Ukraine to CEB member countries in Eastern Europe, the Bank has already lined up concrete measures to address the situation on the ground,” CEB Governor Carlo Monticelli noted. “The approved grant to IOM Slovakia is our first step to ensure that the refugees receive immediate and tailored assistance. We will continue to engage with our stakeholders and partners in the field to allocate financing where it is most needed.”

In coordination with the national authorities, IOM Slovakia´s specialised team will set up information points at Slovak-Ukrainian border crossings to provide humanitarian assistance to Ukrainian citizens and third-country nationals fleeing Ukraine based on their individual needs. This includes securing basic needs, such as food, clothes and medical care, as well as legal support, information and counselling. 

IOM Slovakia will also provide refugees and third-country nationals with safe transportation from the border area to available reception centres or other identified accommodation, mental health support, assistance in interpretation and cultural mediation. It will also offer comprehensive counselling and assistance to those who plan to travel further within the Slovak Republic, return to their countries of origin, or to other EU destination countries. 

In addition, IOM Slovakia will gather data on numbers and profiles of those arriving at border crossings, which will lead to better follow-up assistance and inclusion of those staying in the Slovak Republic.

“People fleeing Ukraine were forced to leave everything behind and they have a very difficult road ahead,” said Zuzana Vatralova, Head IOM’s Office in the Slovak Republic. “This critical funding is so welcome because it will help to provide these people with immediate support, essential information and assistance based on their individual needs.”

IOM Slovakia will involve all relevant state, regional or local institutions, as well as civil society organisations and private sector. It will also liaise with United Nations partners, IOM missions in countries of origin or transit, and embassies.
