UK for UNHCR launches urgent Ukraine Emergency appeal

As the situation for civilians in Ukraine deteriorates rapidly, UK for UNHCR has launched an urgent appeal for funds so that UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, can continue delivering essential support for displaced people across the country and the region. 

Immediate needs include shelter and relief items for those fleeing their homes, as well as specialist protection, such as psychological support. 

There are reports that ongoing military action has caused casualties and forced more civilians to flee their homes to seek safety. At the end of 2021 there were already almost three million people in Ukraine in need of humanitarian support, including more than 850,000 people displaced by conflict, 5,000 refugees from other countries and 35,000 stateless people. 

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, stated: "We have already seen reports of casualties and people starting to flee their homes to seek safety... The humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war but countless lives will be torn apart." 

UNHCR teams and partners in Ukraine have been providing critical relief items and shelter to people forced to flee. They are now working with the authorities in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries to scale up assistance as needed. 

However, as more people require immediate relief, UNHCR teams need support urgently. 

Emma Cherniavsky, Chief Executive of UK for UNHCR, said: "This is a dark day for Ukraine but UNHCR teams continue to work around the clock to support displaced civilians. The most critical needs right now include shelter and basic relief items for people fleeing their homes -- we urgently appeal to the British public to support these humanitarian efforts." 

The UN Refugee Agency has been working in Ukraine since 1994 and will continue to help those displaced by conflict wherever necessary and possible.
