Ukraine Situation Flash Update #3 (15 March 2022)

**BACKGROUND**

The Russian Federation launched a military offensive against Ukraine on 24 February 2022. In less than three weeks, some 3 million refugees have been forced to flee Ukraine, while an additional 1.85 million people have been displaced internally within the country. An estimated 12.65 million people have been affected in the areas hardest hit by the war within Ukraine.

The escalation of conflict has triggered an immediate and steep rise in humanitarian needs, both within the country as well as in the neighbouring countries receiving refugees.

Many people remain trapped in areas of escalating conflict and, with essential services disrupted, are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines.

UNHCR continues to call for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, respect for international humanitarian law, and appealed to neighbouring countries to continue keeping their borders open to those fleeing.
