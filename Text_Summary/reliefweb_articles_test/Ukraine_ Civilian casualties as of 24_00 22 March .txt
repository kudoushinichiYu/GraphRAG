Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 22 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK]

**Date: 23 March 2022**

From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine
started, to 24:00 midnight on 22 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner
for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 2,571 civilian casualties in the country: 977 killed and 1,594
injured. This included:

- a total of 977 killed (196 men, 144 women, 12 girls, and 27 boys, as well as 42 children
and 556 adults whose sex is yet unknown)

- a total of 1,594 injured (174 men, 136 women, 24 girls, and 20 boys, as well as 64
children and 1,176 adults whose sex is yet unknown)

o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,102 casualties (279 killed and 823 injured)

 On Government-controlled territory: 845 casualties (224 killed and 621
injured)

 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 257 casualties
(55 killed and 202 injured)

o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv,
Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and
Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties
occurred: 1,469 casualties (698 killed and 771 injured)

Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide
impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile
and air strikes.

OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from
some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are
still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region),
Izium (Kharkiv region), Sievierodonetsk and Rubizhne (Luhansk region), and Trostianets (Sumy
region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further
corroborated and are not included in the above statistics.

OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8
a.m. (local time) 23 March, 121 children had been killed and 167 injured. OHCHR also notes the
report of the Head of the Investigative Department of the National Police of Kharkiv region,
according to which as of 6 p.m. (local time) 22 March, 286 civilians had been killed in the region,
including 15 children. 

**The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine**

Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on
information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through
interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially
shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic
records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and
national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data
from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance
and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may
take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information
becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time.
Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation’s military action in Ukraine,
HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All
other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and
partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are
based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of
proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent
observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described.
