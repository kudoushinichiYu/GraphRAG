**TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF SO YOU CAN SUPPORT CHILDREN**    
- When the stress is too much, take a moment for yourself.    
- Listen to your breath as it goes in and out.    
- You can put a hand on your stomach and feel it rise and fall with each breath.  
- Then just listen to your breath for a while. Try this every day. You are amazing.
