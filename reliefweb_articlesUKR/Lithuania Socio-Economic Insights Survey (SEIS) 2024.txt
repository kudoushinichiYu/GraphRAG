Lithuania Socio-Economic Insights Survey (SEIS) 2024

The 2024 Socio-Economic Insights Survey (SEIS) in Lithuania, conducted under the Regional Refugee Response Plan for the Ukraine Situation, provides a detailed analysis of the socio-economic conditions of Ukrainian refugees in Lithuania. Covering 638 households and 1,445 individuals, the survey employed purposive sampling and in-person Kobo-based interviews. It focused on areas such as demographics, protection, education, socio-economic inclusion, health, and accommodation. Data collection, carried out between May and June 2024 by the Lithuanian Red Cross and the International Organization for Migration, offers valuable insights into refugee needs, challenges, and integration trends. Findings aim to guide strategic planning and resource allocation to address service gaps and enhance refugee support in Lithuania.
