Bombing into submission: Russian targeting of civilians and infrastructure in Ukraine

The third year of Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine saw Russia scale up its aerial campaign against civilians, resulting in a record-high spike in civilian targeting and an increased civilian death toll. But analyzing just direct Russian attacks that led to deaths or injuries reveals only a part of the grim reality for civilians living in Ukraine. This report extends the discussion on the war’s impact on civilians by analyzing over 5,500 events targeting civilian infrastructure, tracked with [newly introduced ACLED tags](https://acleddata.com/knowledge-base/ukraine-civilian-infrastructure-automated-tags/). These data reveal a pattern of indiscriminate strikes on residential houses, medical facilities, educational institutions, and the energy sector across Ukraine. Russia’s attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine inflict increasingly severe hardships on civilians, making Ukraine ever more dependent on external support and complicating ongoing and future recovery efforts.
