**€139.2 billio in overall support to Ukraine and Ukrainians including €1.5 billion from the proceeds of Russian immobilised assets**

The EU stands united in its unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s war of aggression and its illegal attempts to annex Ukrainian territory.

The EU continues to work relentlessly with international partners to make sure Ukraine receives the material support it needs and to hold Russia accountable for its actions.

The EU has also offered temporary protection to over four million people fleeing the war and is committed to continue providing strong political, financial, economic, humanitarian, military and diplomatic **support to Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes**.

The EU opened accession negotiations with Ukraine.

**SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE’S ECONOMY**

The EU has established a dedicated financing instrument of up to **€50 billion** to provide predictable and flexible support to Ukraine for the period 2024-2027 to support its recovery, reconstruction and modernisation, in line with its EU path. The **Ukraine Facility** is operational since 1 March 2024.

In 2024, a total amount of **€16.5 billion** of direct assistance to Ukraine has been provided and **€16.4 billion** disbursed so far. Additionally, as part of the Ukraine Investment Framework, the first **€1.4 billion** in grants and guarantee agreements were signed in June at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Berlin to support Ukraine’s recovery and attract private sector investments; this will allow the beneficiary international financial institutions to provide support to financial intermediaries and final beneficiaries in Ukraine for an amount of **€3.2 billion**. It will notably focus on the repair, rehabilitation and development of energy and transport infrastructure, support municipalities, as well as enhance access to finance for SMEs.

Following up on the commitments by G7 leaders and based on a proposal by the Commission, the EU adopted a new financial assistance package to Ukraine. It consists of an exceptional macro-financial assistance (MFA) loan of up to approximately **€18 billion** and a loan cooperation mechanism that will support Ukraine in repaying loans provided by the EU and G7 partners for up to **€45 billion**. The loan cooperation mechanism is to be financed by extraordinary revenues stemming from immobilised Russian sovereign assets. **€4 billion** of this exceptional MFA has been disbursed so far.

In 2023, the EU budget enabled **€19.5 billion** in assistance to Ukraine, including an unprecedented support package of **€18 billion** in concessional loans.

This was on top of **€11.6 billion** provided in loans and grants in 2022. This support helped Ukraine keep paying wages and pensions, restore critical infrastructure that is destroyed by the war, maintain essential public services, such as hospitals, schools, and housing for relocated people, and ensure overall macroeconomic stability. As part of this assistance in 2023, the EU mobilised **€1 billion** for fast recovery, while guarantee agreements were signed with international financial institutions with potential capacity to unlock over **€800 million** in investments from the Ukrainian private sector for the recovery and reconstruction of the country’s economy.
