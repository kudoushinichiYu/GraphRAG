Research of Mykhailo-Lukashivska Community, Zaporizhia Region: Analysis of infrastructure, social and economic needs

**METHODOLOGY**

The methodology for assessing the needs of communities affected by hostilities serves as the foundation for collecting accurate and systematic data, which is crucial for effective recovery and support. Armed conflicts cause significant damage not only to physical infrastructure but also to the social and economic well-being of communities.

The recovery of such communities is a complex and multifaceted process that requires clear organization and detailed analysis.  
 The methodological approach to this study includes several key stages:

- Planning and preparation
- Data collection and verification
- Analytical assessment

Each of these stages has specific objectives and tools that ensure the efficient collection, validation, and analysis of information.

**Data Collection**

The data collection process for this study, covering 26 settlements within the Mykhailo-Lukashivska community, was conducted in several stages. The primary focus was on field monitoring and the collection of statistical data through electronic forms (Kobo forms), which enabled the acquisition of both qualitative and quantitative information on the current state of the settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region.

**Field Missions: Key Informant Interviews (KI) and Focus Groups**

**Key Informant Interviews** – One key informant was interviewed in each administrative unit. These informants were representatives of local authorities or responsible officials with in-depth knowledge of infrastructure conditions, economic status, social services, and security issues.

**Focus Group Discussions** – In each administrative unit of the community, a focus group discussion was conducted with local residents, allowing for a broader understanding of community needs and challenges.

The on-site monitoring resulted in primary data. The survey identified the main problems. This direct communication with the population helps to better understand their needs and priorities for further community reconstruction.
