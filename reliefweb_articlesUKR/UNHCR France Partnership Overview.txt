UNHCR France Partnership Overview

France is a reliable donor and ally to UNHCR, consistently offering support to address refugee needs in urgent humanitarian crises around the world.

  
As one of UNHCR's top 5 donors in 2024, France stands out for its prompt and flexible funding support. In 2024, French contributions primarily targeted pressing situations in Ukraine, Sudan and neighbouring countries, Lebanon and Syria. It also encompassed critically underfunded operations in Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Chad and Ethiopia.

As a resettlement country, France welcomes around 3000 refugees each year, providing people with an opportunity to start a new life.

As one of the co-conveners of the 2023 Global Refugee Forum, France plays a pivotal role in mobilizing efforts and collaborates closely with UNHCR across various priority areas, including socio-economic inclusion, private sector engagement, climate change mitigation in displacement settings, and ensuring the protection and integration of refugee women and girls
