EU 4 Gender Equality: Together against gender stereotypes and gender-based violence – Key results in 2024

This brief highlights the results achieved by the programme “EU 4 Gender Equality: Together against gender stereotypes and gender-based violence” (Phase 2) in 2024. The second phase of the programme seeks to reduce gender discriminatory attitudes and practices in institutional and community spheres by continuing and upscaling successful initiatives and interventions from the first phase.

During the first implementation year of Phase 2 (1 January - 31 December 2024), the programme reached almost 6.8 million people through innovative campaigns that challenge gender stereotypes and discriminatory social norms. 19 new Fathers’ Schools were established in 2024 in Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. Since 2020, 4,856 men have participated in 68 Fathers’ Schools across the programme countries. The programme also supported 25 grassroots initiatives led by civil society and women’s organizations to transform discriminatory gender norms.
