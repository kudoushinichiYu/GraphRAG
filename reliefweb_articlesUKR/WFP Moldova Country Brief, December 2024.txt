**Operational Updates**

- WFP continued to provide three daily hot meals to refugees in Refugee Accommodation Centres (RACs) across Moldova. In December, WFP supported 1,450 refugees in 24 RACs. Where Government-approved kitchen facilities are available, WFP offers commodity vouchers worth 100 Moldovan Leu (MDL) (~USD 5) per person per day to purchase food for onsite cooking. In RACs without kitchen facilities, WFP contracts catering services to ensure meal provision. As of early December 2024, eight RACs were supported through on-site cooking services, while 16 relied on catering services.
- In alignment with the Ministry Labour and Social Protection (MLSP) consolidation strategy to reorganize and enhance RAC operations, 18 RACs were closed in 2024.
- WFP distributed 167 snacks and hot meals to Ukrainian refugees entering Moldova through Palanca and Otaci borders.
- WFP continued to distribute bi-monthly cash-based assistance to Moldovan households hosting Ukrainian refugees, helping to offset some of the accommodation-related financial burdens. In December, the 16th round of distribution was successfully completed. This provided the remaining 342 households (882 beneficiaries) with an opportunity to cash out their assistance. Households hosting 1 to 4 refugees received MDL 3,900 (USD 217), while those hosting more than four refugees received MDL 4,800 (USD 268).
- For the third consecutive year, WFP, under the guidance of MLSP and in partnership with International Organization for Migration (IOM), provided temporary cash-based assistance to support vulnerable Moldovan households, including pensioners and households caring for children with disabilities. In December, WFP provided assistance to 29,948 individuals through cash transfers, helping them meet essential needs such as food and energy expenses. This cash assistance offers financial independence and upholds dignity.
