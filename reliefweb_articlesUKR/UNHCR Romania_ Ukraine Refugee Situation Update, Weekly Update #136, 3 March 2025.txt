He reaffirmed UNHCR’s commitment to continue working in cooperation with partners and authorities to help refugees most in need and the Romanian communities hosting them.

On 24 February, the Prefect of Brasov and UNHCR co-chaired the Inclusion of Refugees Working Group (WG). The first coordination meeting of the year brought together over 20 participants from 17 institutions and organizations to discuss key issues affecting refugees from Ukraine, including access to education, social assistance, the labour market, and healthcare, and support to the Brasov communities hosting them. The meeting served to exchange experiences and identified best practices, while also addressing challenges hindering refugees' inclusion in the local community. Supporting local coordination networks is an integral part of UNHCR's localization strategy and aligns with the objectives of the 2025-2026 Refugee Response Plan.
