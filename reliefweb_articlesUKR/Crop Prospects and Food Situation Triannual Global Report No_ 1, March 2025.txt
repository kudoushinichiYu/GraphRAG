Crop Prospects and Food Situation Triannual Global Report No. 1, March 2025

## **Regional Highlights**

**AFRICA** Prolonged dry weather conditions in North Africa are dampening 2025 production prospects, while favourable rainfall conditions in Southern Africa are benefiting crops, and 2025 cereal harvests are expected to rebound following steep declines in 2024. Good weather conditions supported above-average 2024 harvests in both East and West Africa, but conflict continues to disrupt agricultural activities and reduce yields in several countries. Planting of the 2025 crops is underway in both subregions.

**ASIA** In Far East Asia, the early outlook points to continued growth in wheat production in 2025, primarily driven by large plantings and good yield prospects in key producing countries, supported by favourable weather conditions. However, in Near East Asia, poor rainfall since late 2024 has weakened yield potentials and wheat production could drop to below-average levels.

**LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN** In South America, mixed weather conditions and the risk of stunt disease outbreaks are containing the production outlook for 2025 maize, though aggregate production is still expected to remain above average, mainly due to an anticipated good outturn in Brazil. In Central America and the Caribbean, dry weather conditions have reduced cereal plantings and curbed production prospects in Mexico, whereas favourable weather elsewhere in the subregion is expected to boost yields.
