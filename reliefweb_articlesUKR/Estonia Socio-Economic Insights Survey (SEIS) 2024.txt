Estonia Socio-Economic Insights Survey (SEIS) 2024

The 2024 Socio-Economic Insights Survey (SEIS) in Estonia, conducted under the Regional Refugee Response Plan for the Ukraine Situation, provides a detailed analysis of the socio-economic conditions of Ukrainian refugees in Estonia. Covering 600 households and 1,409 individuals, the survey employs purposive sampling and in-person Kobo-based interviews. It focuses on areas such as demographics, protection, education, socio-economic inclusion, health, and accommodation. Data collection, carried out between May and June 2024 by the International Organization for Migration and the Estonian Refugee Council, offers valuable insights into refugee needs, challenges, and integration trends. Findings aim to guide strategic planning and resource allocation to address service gaps and enhance refugee support in Estonia.
