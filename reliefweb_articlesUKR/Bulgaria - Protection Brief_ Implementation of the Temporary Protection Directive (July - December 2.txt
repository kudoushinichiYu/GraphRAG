Bulgaria - Protection Brief: Implementation of the Temporary Protection Directive (July - December 2024) [EN/BG]

**Operational Context**

The Council of Ministers extended temporary protection on 19 February [until 4 March 2026, in line with the decision of the European Council](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/06/25/ukrainian-refugees-council-extends-temporary-protection-until-march-2026/pdf/). The decision allows for re-registration of the TP beneficiaries until April 2025.

From July to December 2024, 13,306 refugees applied or renewed their TP in Bulgaria upon return from Ukraine or a third country, reflecting an increase in registration rates – by 13 per cent – compared to 2023. The total number of refugees under temporary protection present in Bulgaria as of end of December 2024 was 74,739. In the second half of 2024, there has been a five per cent increase in older individuals who have newly registered or re-registered for Temporary Protection compared to the first half of the year. The highest concentration of valid TP holders is in Burgas region (36%), Varna region (21%) and Sofia city (14%). For new arrivals, the deterioration in the security situation in Ukraine and ongoing crisis (e.g., electricity cuts) remain the main reasons for seeking temporary protection in Bulgaria. There are also refugees moving to Bulgaria from Germany, Poland, other EU Member States (9% of 2,320 newly arriving refugees surveyed), and Türkiye, as indicated by the UNHCR rapid assessment in the summer of 2024. The main reasons include the end of humanitarian support in these countries; prospects of job opportunities in a country with a language easier to learn; and closer proximity to Ukraine to allow family visits.

The Bulgarian Government maintains administrative practices that give access to people displaced from Ukraine through its borders, granting temporary protection to 204,000 refugees since March 2022 until the end of 2024. It maintains humanitarian accommodation to more than 5,620 Ukrainian refugees with specific protection needs. The Agency for Social Assistance provided at least one social benefit to almost 17,450 refugees by end of October 2024, and the Employment Agency supported the employment of 2,855 refugees under the Solidarity Platform. An expanded Humanitarian Support Programme is pending the approval of the Committee of Ministers.

Data used in this report was collected as part of [UNHCR Bulgaria’s Protection Profiling and Monitoring exercise](https://data.unhcr.org/en/dataviz/392?sv=54&geo=0) for the Ukraine Situation, in partnership with the Bulgarian Red Cross, for the purposes of understanding the profiles, protection risks and needs of refugees from Ukraine and monitoring changes over time. During July to December 2024, protection monitoring interviews with 781 respondents representing 2,010 household members were conducted in various locations in Bulgaria. The findings are complemented by UNHCR participatory assessments through [focus group discussions with 350 individuals in December 2024](https://data.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/114417) and the Socio-Economic Insights Survey that was conducted in June-July 2024 with 1,072 households.
