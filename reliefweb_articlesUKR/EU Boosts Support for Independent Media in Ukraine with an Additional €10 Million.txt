EU Boosts Support for Independent Media in Ukraine with an Additional €10 Million

The European Union (EU) is increasing its support for **independent media in Ukraine** with a **new €10 million** funding package. An essential component of EU values is to uphold a vibrant independent media space, as a key cornerstone of democracy. Support to independent media is particularly important given the strength of the Russia hybrid and disinformation war. This new funding builds on more than **€100 million the European Union has already invested in independent media since 2017**. This significant funding highlights the EU’s long-term commitment to Ukrainian media, ensuring their continued ability to operate independently, produce high-quality journalism, and fight disinformation.

From the very first days and weeks of the Russian full-scale invasion, EU financing provided a lifeline for dozens of media outlets and brave journalists through emergency grants provided via its partner, the European Endowment of Democracy. EU has supported the **establishment of journalists centre in Przemyśl**, Poland, to serve as a workspace for media evacuated from Ukraine that were able to get the news on the Russian aggression to the world. **Since the full scale invasion**, the EU has supported independent media with around **€37 million in grants**.

*“The EU has always been a steadfast supporter of independent media in Ukraine because a free press is the lifeblood of democracy. Since Russia’s full-scale aggression against Ukraine, local journalists have shown relentless bravery, risking everything to report the truth from the front lines. Their work doesn’t just inform—it holds power to account and remains crucial in Ukraine’s path to the European Union. Russia’s aggression extends beyond the battlefield; Russia uses massive disinformation to undermine unity and reduce international support. A strong independent media in Ukraine is more crucial than ever, and EU funding will help sustain it. As Russia wages a war on the truth itself, EU stands unwavering,” stressed **Katarína Mathernová, EU Ambassador to Ukraine.***

**TODAY’S ANNOUNCEMENT:**

EU will provide **€10 million** for independent media, to ensure their sustainability and to allow this important pillar of democracy to thrive.
