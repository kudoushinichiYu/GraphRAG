Terms of Reference Protection Working Group Hungary (2025)

**Background**

Since 2022, over 47,000 refugees have applied for Temporary Protection. A significant number of refugees have also chosen to reside on the territory under other forms of legal stay, including residents permits. With five land border crossings, the country remains a critical entry point for people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine, including Hungarian dual nationals.

The humanitarian response is coordinated by the Hungarian government and UNHCR, which established an Inter-Agency mechanism and the Ukraine Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP).

**Objectives**

The Hungary Protection Working Group (PWG) provides technical guidance to protection actors in Hungary, to ensure effective, coherent and predictable interventions to support the governmentâ€™s efforts to respond to the protection needs of refugees and other persons in need of international protection. The Protection Working Group (PWG) comprises the child protection and Gender-based Violence (GBV) sub-sectors.

The PWG aims to coordinate stakeholders, provide strategic guidance and technical inputs, share information effectively, identify gaps and opportunities, strengthen the protection sector through research and evidence, build capacity across stakeholders, improve data management for evidence-based programming, and leverage the comparative strengths of each member.
