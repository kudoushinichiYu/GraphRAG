Hungarian Interchurch Aid’s response to the crisis caused by the war in Ukraine – Multisectoral assistance in a prolonged crisis 2022-2025

For 3 years now, Hungarian Interchurch Aid has been helping both in Ukraine and in Hungary through its multisectoral aid programme featuring in-kind aid, cash assistance, psychosocial support, community-based grants and reconstruction. Operating across 23 regions of Ukraine, from Berehove to Bilozerske and from Kharkiv to Kherson, HIA has helped 800 thousand Ukrainians, often in areas that are difficult to access.

When millions left everything behind, HIA delivered food, hygiene and medicine; when the winter set in, it handed out essential items, firewood and winterisation support; and when catastrophes hit hard, HIA provided electric generators and water pumps to facilitate recovery. HIA's response however encompasses not only immediate relief, but also reconstruction and development projects, including the renovation of homes and critical infrastructure such as schools and healthcare facilities. Through community-based grants, HIA empowers local, grassroot-level civil society organisations to address community needs effectively. Recognising the mental health challenges caused by this protracted crisis, HIA’s response also aims to preserve the mental wellbeing of the war-affected populations, especially of children.

Besides Ukraine, HIA has played a crucial role in assisting refugees arriving to Hungary: by creating the Support Centre for Ukrainian Refugees in Budapest, all essential services are available for refugees in a central hub. Even though the war seems to go on with no end in sight, our promise is that Hungarian Interchurch Aid will be there for those in need both, in Ukraine as in Hungary - like it has been for the past 3 years
