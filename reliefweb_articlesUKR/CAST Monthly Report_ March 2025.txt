CAST Monthly Report: March 2025

*Author: Trey Billing*

The ACLED Conflict Alert System (CAST) forecasts organized political violence up to six months into the future. Forecasts are made globally - at the national and sub-national levels - and can be disaggregated by event type (*battles*, *explosions/remote violence*, or *violence against civilians*). Every month, ACLED CAST produces a report highlighting key conflict developments and significant predictions for the coming months.

This report reflects the **March 2025** update of global forecasts.
