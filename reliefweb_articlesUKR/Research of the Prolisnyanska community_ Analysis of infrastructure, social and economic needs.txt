Research of the Prolisnyanska community: Analysis of infrastructure, social and economic needs

**METHODOLOGY**

The methodology of researching the needs of communities affected by hostilities is the basis for collecting accurate and systematic data that is critical for the effective recovery and support of these communities. Warfare causes significant damage not only to the physical infrastructure, but also to the social and economic fabric of society. Rebuilding such communities is a complex and multifaceted process that requires clear organisation and detailed analysis.

The methodological approach to this study involves several key stages:

\- planning and preparation

\- data collection and verification, and analytical work.

Each of these stages has its own specific tasks and tools to ensure effective collection, verification and analysis of information.

**DATA COLLECTION**

The process of data collection for the study, consisting of six starostas, namely Bazaliyivka, Hrakivka, Ivanivka, Korobchyn, Lebyazh, Yurchenka and Prolisnyansky, was carried out in several stages. The main focus was on on-site monitoring and collection of statistical data through electronic forms (cobo-forms), which allowed to obtain both qualitative and quantitative information on the current state of the community's settlements.
