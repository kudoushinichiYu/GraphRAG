Ukraine: 3 years of war

War Child has provided life-changing support to 247,657 children and families affected by the war in Ukraine since 2022.

Since the war broke out in Ukraine in February 2022, the war has claimed thousands of lives, putting children and their families at constant risk while reducing vital services, like heat and water, to rubble. The conflict has caused the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has also identified Ukraine as one of the countries where [grave violations against children](https://www.warchild.org.uk/news/what-are-grave-violations) are being committed, with at least 596 children killed and 1,725 injured, due to Russia’s invasion.

## **Right now, 2.9 million children are homeless.**

**5.3 million need urgent education support.**  
**1.5 million are struggling with their mental health.**

These are not just numbers; they are children’s lives. Every school destroyed, every child displaced, every scar left by this war will echo for generations.

Serhiy, 10, struggled with severe anxiety and mood swings after being forced from his home by the war, making social interactions difficult. Through individual and group therapy sessions, as well as sports activities, he began to show remarkable improvement.

> **I really see changes in Serhiy’s behaviour and attitude… It is difficult for me to attend sessions with a psychologist, but I now understand both my child and myself better.**

Partnering with local charities and the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine means that War Child can work across country including in Zaporizhia, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Mykolaiv, Dnipro, Sumy as well as areas where families have fled to such as Chernivtsi and Khmelnytskyi. We have also supported refugees in Hungary, Poland and other neighbouring countries.

Our education programme, Can’t Wait to Learn, is one of the few remaining options for children to continue their education when schools have to shut. Its role and impact are more critical than ever.

Can’t Wait to Learn uses tablets, laptops, and mobile phones to deliver education in communities more deeply affected by the conflict or where resources are limited. Co-created with Ukrainian children and artists, it is designed to feel familiar and align with the national curriculum, helping children learn to read and develop numeracy skills at their own pace. Without this support, many children would not be receiving any education at all.

Since its launch in September 2022, Can’t Wait to Learn has helped over 140,000 children restart their education. A true community is forming, with over 4,500 teachers across Ukraine receiving monthly support from our team.

Since May 2024, to address the urgent mental health and protection needs of more than 67,000 children and families, War Child and our partners are providing access to essential child protection, education, and mental health services. 11,705 children have participated in activities like play and sport to help them heal from trauma, while 1,456 teachers and caregivers have received wellbeing sessions.

*“We are providing children and parents with a safe environment where they can process their emotions. It gives them a sense of normalcy in a chaotic environment. These spaces also offer caregivers respite, allowing them to rest and take care of their own wellbeing.”* - **Yevgeniya Pavlova, All-Ukrainian Foundation for Children's Rights, War Child partner.**

War Child and our partners have also trained facilitators and teachers in child protection, safeguarding, and data protection, equipping them with the skills to safely support children.

*“We are fostering safe, inclusive, and emotionally supportive learning environments. It equips children with resilience, empathy, and problem-solving skills, helping them process trauma and navigate daily challenges.”* - **Anna Volokhova, Montessori UA, War Child partner.**
