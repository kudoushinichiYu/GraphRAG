Gender-sensitive macroeconomic policies in low- and middle-income economies

The Russia–Ukraine war has sent shockwaves across the globe, but its impact is not evenly distributed. In Africa, women are disproportionately bearing the brunt of this economic fallout.

This report examines the gender-differentiated economic impacts of the conflict on African economies and potential macroeconomic policy solutions to mitigate them. Specifically, it analyses the gendered dimensions of monetary policy, inward investment promotion and debt restructuring, offering policy recommendations for each.

The report finds that economic shocks have varying impacts on women depending on their economic, migration, health and household status. For instance, rising prices for essential goods have disproportionately affected women, who often face unequal access to resources and finance, coupled with greater care responsibilities.

The report argues that conventional macroeconomic policy responses have been inadequate in addressing these gendered impacts. It proposes that central banks dedicate more resources to understanding these disparities and implement targeted complementary measures. Furthermore, it suggests that promoting diversified inward foreign direct investment (FDI) and debt restructuring can help mitigate the negative impacts of economic shocks on women.

**Key messages**

- The inflation shock stemming from the Russia–Ukraine war affected fuel, food and fertiliser prices, with multifaceted and gender-differentiated impacts in some sub-Saharan Africa depending on women’s economic position. US dollar appreciation could exacerbate this further.
- Macroeconomic policy, including monetary policy tools, foreign investment and debt restructuring, among others, has fallen short in mitigating gendered impacts, given the ongoing informality in female work, male overrepresentation in interest rate-sensitive sectors and debt servicing, limiting policy space.
- Reframing and implementing macroeconomic policies in developing economies in a way that offsets gender-differentiated income and price effects, and that increases and scales social safety nets and access to resources, and economy‐wide productivity, could better support resilience.

**Note:** This paper draws evidence from existing literature and secondary data on the gendered impacts of economic crises and policies. The analysis benefited greatly from the findings in four studies from a project led by the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC), the Economic Research Forum (ERF) and the Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP) and supported by Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC).
