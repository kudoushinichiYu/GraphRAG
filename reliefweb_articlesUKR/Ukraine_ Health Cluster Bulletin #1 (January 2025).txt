- In response to the US funding freeze, the Health Cluster assessed its impact by engaging affected partners. This enabled mapping of service gaps and identifying alternative resources. Collaboration with health authorities continues daily to find temporary solutions, ensuring vulnerable populations receive life-saving care despite strained capacities.
- The 2025 [Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan (HNRP)](https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-needs-and-response-plan-2025-january-2025-enuk) was launched on 15 January 2025, outlining urgent priorities for Ukraine. The humanitarian health response will require US $130 million to provide life-saving care to the most vulnerable people affected by the war. This funding is critical to ensure access to essential health services, including trauma care, primary healthcare, mental health support, and medical supply distribution in conflict-affected areas.
