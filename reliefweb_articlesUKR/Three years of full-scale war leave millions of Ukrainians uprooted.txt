Three years of full-scale war leave millions of Ukrainians uprooted

## Ukrainian women and girls’ voices must be central to conflict resolution

**February 21, 2025** – Ahead of the three-year mark of full-scale war, the situation of the people in Ukraine remains dire. The humanitarian need is tremendous, and the scale of forced displacement is the largest in Europe.

“It is crucial to ensure that the voices of those most affected are heard and that their well-being remains central to any effort towards conflict resolution,” **said Daria Chekalova, CARE Ukraine Advocacy Advisor**. “Women make up the majority of the displaced population, and women’s rights and women-led organizations lead the humanitarian response. They must be guaranteed a role in decision-making that concerns the end of the war and plans for the reconstruction and recovery of Ukraine. For three years, millions of Ukrainians have lived in uncertainty, unable to return home, forced to rebuild their lives far from the places they once knew.”

The scale of displacement is staggering, with more Ukrainians uprooted from their homes than the population of Switzerland. There are nearly 6.8 million Ukrainian refugees worldwide, with 63 percent women and girls. Inside Ukraine, an additional 3.6 million people are internally displaced, with 46% percent women. Facing the dire effects of intense conflict, millions of people across Ukraine require humanitarian assistance but, with global funding drastically cut, there are fears that many will go without.

After three years of full-scale war, CARE is calling on the international community to continue its life-saving response.

“Any future peace must not only end the fighting, but also ensure the rights, dignity and future of those who were most affected by this war and had to flee their homes,” **said Yuliia Sporysh, head of NGO Girls**, an organization that partners with CARE.
