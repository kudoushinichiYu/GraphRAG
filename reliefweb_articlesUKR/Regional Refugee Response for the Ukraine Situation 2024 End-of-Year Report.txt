Regional Refugee Response for the Ukraine Situation 2024 End-of-Year Report

**Regional Overview**

The war in Ukraine has been the fastest growing and largest displacement crisis in Europe since World War II, leading to a large-scale regional refugee response.

The 2024 Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP) for the Ukraine Situation outlined the multisector response strategy of local, national and international humanitarian partners and included country chapters detailing the support to the host Governments of Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Republic of Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.  

The 2024 RRP detailed practical and specialized support from partners to host countries through four pillars. These included ensuring refugees could access legal status and rights, offering targeted assistance to refugees with specific needs and vulnerabilities, enhancing refugees' selfreliance and socio-economic inclusion as well as fostering social cohesion between refugee and host communities.

Mainstreamed across these four strategic objectives were a number of cross-cutting response priorities, such as mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS); accountability to affected people; protection from sexual exploitation and abuse; localization; Government ownership and maintaining emergency capacities.

This end-of-year report, covering 2024, captures the progress and achievements made against the strategic objectives and identifies gaps and consequences of underfunding. It also includes advocacy messages targeting Government, donors and other key stakeholders and highlights the important work done by local and national partners. It is accompanied by regional and country level reporting on funding levels and output indicators and should be read alongside the Refugee Response Plan covering 2025-26.
