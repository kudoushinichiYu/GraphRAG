Advocacy brief – Three years of full-scale war in Ukraine [EN/UK]

Three years into the war in Ukraine, the toll on civilians remains devastating — especially for women and girls. Yet, amid the hardship, Ukrainian communities and civil society organizations continue to show remarkable resilience, bolstered by international support.

“When there’s a ballistic warning, I take my grandson and we hide in the corridor, following the two-wall rule. When we hear explosions, we fly to the corridor like a bullet. So fast. Some explosions are short and sharp, just like a clap or whip. Others have a higher volume and grow in intensity. After three years, we have a routine. I always stay on alert. I often sit and wait for explosions, the sirens and alerts to end and my panic is rising.” Tatiana, Dnipro.

Humanitarian needs remain critical, as lives and communities are devastated by attacks against civilian infrastructure. Particularly on the frontlines, civilians are at risk from relentless attacks. In 2025, the Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan (HNRP) aims to reach one-sixth of people with assistance in Ukraine, 6 million people in grave need. Most of the support will be provided by Ukrainian organisations and groups, with women led (WLOs) and women’s rights organisations (WROs) at the forefront.

At the same time, civil society organisations (CSOs) are preparing for the reconstruction and development of Ukraine. Although hostilities are ongoing in many parts of the country, local and national organisations are ready to rebuild wherever possible. Yet, communities and organizations face severe threats, as outlined in this brief.
