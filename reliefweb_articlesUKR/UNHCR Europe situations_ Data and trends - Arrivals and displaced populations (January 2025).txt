UNHCR Europe situations: Data and trends - Arrivals and displaced populations (January 2025)

**UKRAINE SITUATION**

The war in Ukraine triggered a major increase in humanitarian needs due to the mass internal displacement within Ukraine as well as refugee outflows. By the end of January, 6,346,300 refugees from Ukraine were recorded across Europe, with 6,325,125 registered for asylum, temporary protection or similar national protection schemes. As of end-December 2024, 3.7 million people were displaced internally within Ukraine.

During 2024, border crossings from and to Ukraine were three per cent lower than in 2023, with around 1.2 million monthly movements in each direction on average. Border crossings continued to exhibit seasonal fluctuations associated to short term visits and pendular movements. Higher inflows took place during Easter and the summer months, whereas higher outflows occurred in subsequent weeks. UNHCR observed higher net outflows from Ukraine during May - June owing partially to seasonal movements, new displacements due to the escalation of attacks and amendments to the mobilization law.
