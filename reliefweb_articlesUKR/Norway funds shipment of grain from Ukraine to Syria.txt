Norway funds shipment of grain from Ukraine to Syria

Russia’s war on Ukraine has exacerbated global challenges related to food security. Through our support for the 'Grain from Ukraine' initiative, Norway helps ensure that food grain reaches those who need it most while also supporting Ukraine’s economy’, said Minister of International Development Åsmund Aukrust.

From 2022 to 2024, Norway has contributed NOK 175 million to the Ukrainian initiative "Grain from Ukraine" to support food security in conflict-affected countries. In December, President Zelenskyy announced that Syria would be among the recipient countries of this aid. So far, 4,349 tons of wheat flour have been milled and delivered to people in need in Syria. Norway has contributed USD 4,6 million to this shipment of wheat from the WFP’s Ukrainian stockpiles in Türkiye.

‘Our efforts for global food security continue. Grain from Ukraine has been crucial in ensuring that Ukrainian food reaches the global market and helps combat hunger in countries like Syria’, said Mr Aukrust.
