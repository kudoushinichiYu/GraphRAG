Ukraine: CCCM Cluster Preparedness Plan for Dnipropetrovska oblast, March 2025

**Overview and Scope**

This plan builds on the national Cluster Preparedness Plan for Evacuations and New Displacement. It provides a contextualized regional-level operational plan for the Dnipropetrovska Oblast, Eastern Ukraine. This plan features likely response triggers, operational constraints, and foreseen challenges based on expert feedback from the humanitarian partners, Clusters, displaced and non-displaced communities, and government administration at the Oblast, Rayon, and Hromada levels. It outlines a phased approach to the response at the reception (transit centres) and in collective sites in the event of large-scale evacuations from the frontline Hromadas of Dnipropetrovska Oblast. This plan will be reviewed on a rolling basis to adjust to the operating context.
