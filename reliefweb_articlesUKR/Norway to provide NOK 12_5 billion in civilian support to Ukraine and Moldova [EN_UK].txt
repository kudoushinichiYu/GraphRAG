Norway to provide NOK 12.5 billion in civilian support to Ukraine and Moldova [EN/UK]

The Norwegian Government will provide NOK 12.5 billion in civilian support to Ukraine and Moldova in 2025. Key focus areas include energy security and humanitarian assistance. The funding is part of the overall allocation for 2025 under the Nansen Support Programme for Ukraine.

Every day for the past three years, the Ukrainian people have been fighting for their freedom. They are not just fighting for Ukraine, but also for the security of Europe as a whole and for a world order based on international law and democratic values. In order to maintain Ukrainian resilience, it is critical for Norway and other countries to continue and increase their support. This applies to both military and civilian support,’ said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.

Of the NOK 35 billion currently allocated under the Nansen Support Programme for Ukraine for 2025, NOK 22.5 billion will be provided as military support and NOK 12.5 billion as civilian support.

‘The scale of military and civilian needs in Ukraine is enormous. The war has caused great hardship and suffering and led to widespread destruction. It is absolutely essential to continue to provide civilian support to Ukraine,’ said Mr Støre.

**Allocation of civilian support in 2025:**

- **Energy security and supply, including nuclear safety and security and purchase of gas:** NOK 4.5 billion
- **Humanitarian assistance:** NOK 3 billion
- **Budget support and reconstruction efforts:** NOK 3.3 billion
- **Business development and the private sector:** NOK 750 million
- **Civil society, accountability, governance:** NOK 540 million
- **Moldova**: NOK 350 million

**Energy security**

As a result of Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, the energy supply is extremely vulnerable. Some NOK 4.5 billion is being allocated to ensure a stable electricity supply and prevent potential major economic and humanitarian ramifications. The funding will be used to purchase gas, repair the power grid, provide emergency generators and support projects to enhance nuclear safety and security.

‘In addition to weapons and ammunition, what Ukraine needs mostly urgently is energy support. In Kyiv, people often have no access to electricity for many hours a day, which has a significant impact on their daily lives. Energy support, including funding for the purchase of gas, is therefore an important component of Norway’s assistance,’ said Mr Støre.

The Ukrainian state-owned company Naftogaz is the recipient of the gas in Ukraine. The funding is channelled through the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (ERDB).

**Need for wide-ranging humanitarian assistance**

Russia’s war on Ukraine has created a pressing need for humanitarian assistance, particularly on the front lines. The UN estimates that more than 12.7 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2025. Norway is therefore continuing its support to humanitarian organisations such as the United Nations, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Norwegian humanitarian partners.

The Ukrainian authorities have implemented important reforms and secured funding for basic services in 2025. However, there is still a need to provide more budget support to the Ukrainian government administration and funding for reconstruction efforts, in particular through the World Bank’s Ukraine Relief, Recovery, Reconstruction and Reform Trust Fund (URTF).

**Business development and civil society**

The reconstruction of Ukraine cannot be financed through public funding alone. However, public funding can be used to mobilise private capital. The 2025 funding allocation includes funds administered by Norfund under the recently established Ukraine Investment Fund. The purpose of the fund is to promote sustainable business activities and job creation in Ukraine.

‘Ukrainian civil society has a crucial role to play in uniting the country and building resilience. Efforts carried out under the civil society organisations enable Ukrainians to participate directly in the reconstruction of their own country. These organisations also play a key role in reform efforts aimed at strengthening freedom of expression and combating corruption,’ said Mr Støre.

Norway supports a number of initiatives and partners that are working to combat corruption and to promote human rights, democracy and good governance. Norway also participates actively in efforts to hold Russia accountable for its war of aggression and violations of international humanitarian law.

**Moldova**

Norway is providing support for Moldova’s efforts to secure its own energy supply and achieve energy independence from Russia, and to combat disinformation and hybrid warfare. Norway is also providing support to the education sector and to the justice sector to promote the rule of law.

**Norway providing substantial support to Ukraine**

Norway has committed to providing Ukraine with a minimum of NOK 155 billion under the Nansen Support Programme for Ukraine for the eight-year period from 2023 to 2030. All the political parties in the Storting have endorsed this support.

Of the NOK 35 billion currently allocated for 2025, NOK 22.5 billion will be provided as military support and NOK 12.5 billion as civilian support.

Norway also provided NOK 12 billion in support in the first phase of the war (2022–2023). This came in addition to the funding allocated under the Nansen Support Programme.
