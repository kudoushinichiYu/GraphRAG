Latvia Socio-Economic Insights Survey (SEIS) 2024

The 2024 Socio-Economic Insights Survey (SEIS) in Latvia, conducted under the Regional Refugee Response Plan for the Ukraine Situation, provides a detailed analysis of the socio-economic conditions of Ukrainian refugees in Latvia. Covering 600 households and 1,278 individuals, the survey employs purposive sampling and in-person Kobo-based interviews. It focuses on areas such as demographics, protection, education, socio-economic inclusion, health, and accommodation. Data collection, carried out between May and June 2024 by SKDS in collaboration with Gribu Palīdzēt Bēgļiem, offers valuable insights into refugee needs, challenges, and integration trends. Findings aim to guide strategic planning and resource allocation to address service gaps and enhance refugee support in Latvia.
