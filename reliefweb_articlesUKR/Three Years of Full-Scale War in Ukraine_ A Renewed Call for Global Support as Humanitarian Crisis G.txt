Three Years of Full-Scale War in Ukraine: A Renewed Call for Global Support as Humanitarian Crisis Grinds on

KYIV - As the war in Ukraine enters its fourth year, Mercy Corps urges sustained international support to meet the growing humanitarian needs of millions affected by the ongoing conflict.

Since 2022, over 6.8 million people have fled Ukraine, with over 4 million displaced by the fighting within the country. Countless families are enduring hardship, loss, and uncertainty.

Mercy Corps has remained steadfast in its work to provide essential aid to civilians in need, and support critical economic infrastructure in the agricultural sector, the backbone of Ukraine’s export economy. This is a critical need, given Ukraine’s grain production has dropped by over 20% since 2022.

**Mercy Corps Response Director for Ukraine, Vicki Aken, says:**

“The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine remains dire. Continued attacks on infrastructure like the power grid affect all aspects of civilian life. Every person in Ukraine, whether on or behind the frontlines, displaced, farmers, and people with vulnerabilities in both rural and urban environments continue to live through the horrors of total war.”

“Any effort to end the war must address the long-term needs of civilians and involve civil society in recovery efforts. Access must be guaranteed for aid groups to meet the needs of those stuck in active fighting and address unexploded ordinances that continue to plague the vital agricultural sector.”

“Mercy Corps is urging governments, donors, and individuals worldwide to renew their commitment to humanitarian aid for Ukraine and its path for recovery and reconstruction. Every contribution, every act of solidarity, makes a difference.
