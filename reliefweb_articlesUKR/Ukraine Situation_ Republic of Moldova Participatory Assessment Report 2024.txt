Ukraine Situation: Republic of Moldova Participatory Assessment Report 2024

**INTRODUCTION**

As of 30 November 2024, the Republic of Moldova continues to provide safety and refuge to approximately 127,000 Ukrainian refugees who remain unable to return to their home country due to the ongoing war.

Additionally, Moldova hosts 10,770 third-country nationals displaced from Ukraine and provides Temporary Protection to more than 64,000 individuals.

Moldova also hosts a growing number of asylum-seekers, stateless persons, and refugees from various regions, reflecting the country’s enduring commitment to international protection and support for displaced populations. Despite confronting economic pressures, including persistent inflation, an energy crisis, and the socio-political complexities of its proximity to Ukraine, Moldova has shown exceptional solidarity and resilience in welcoming those affected by conflict.

Building on its dedication to actively engaging with forcibly displaced and stateless communities, UNHCR conducted the 2024 Participatory Assessment (PA) to gain current insights into the protection risks, needs, and experiences of these populations. This assessment focuses on gathering community perspectives, understanding evolving local capacities, and exploring solutions to address identified challenges. It involved in-person focus group discussions (FGDs) with a diverse group of people in need of international protection, representing women, men, children, and youth across various socio-demographic backgrounds.

A total of 298 individuals participated, including 51 from the left bank of the Dniestr River, ensuring the inclusion of experiences from both sides of the Dniestr River. Among participants, 66% were female and 34% male, with discussions encompassing 15 rayons of Moldova, spanning urban and rural areas, Refugee Accommodation Centers (RACs), the Temporary Accommodation Centre for asylum-seekers, private accommodation, and host families.

This 2024 Participatory Assessment aims to offer updated perspectives to guide UNHCR, Moldovan authorities, and humanitarian and development partners in improving support for displaced communities, improving integration pathways, and addressing any gaps to ensure that Moldova’s remarkable response to displacement remains sustainable, inclusive, and responsive to community needs.

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The 2024 Participatory Assessment conducted by UNHCR in Moldova provides an updated analysis of the protection needs, challenges, and experiences of refugees, asylum-seekers, stateless persons, and host communities. This assessment, carried out in collaboration with 16 UNHCR partners and the Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) Task Force, gathers insights from 298 participants across 44 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) conducted in various urban and rural locations, including the left bank of the Dniestr River.

The report emphasizes the diverse experiences of different groups, including Ukrainian refugees, stateless persons, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable populations, highlighting critical areas such as livelihoods, housing, healthcare, social services, and community cohesion. The 2024 findings underscore the evolving protection risks and gaps in services and recommend actions to improve the response to vulnerabilities.

Key findings show that housing costs, healthcare access, livelihood opportunities, access to education and social services remain primary concerns for refugees, asylum-seekers and stateless persons.

While 2024 recommendations take in consideration what suggested in 2023, they place a stronger focus on targeted support for specific at-risk groups, such as the older persons, persons with disabilities, Roma refugees, and those without a regular legal status.

**The 2024 recommendations build upon those made in 2023 by emphasizing:**

- Long-term accommodation solutions for refugees, including rental assistance and accessible housing.
- A comprehensive approach to healthcare that addresses specialized care needs.
- Stronger integration of vulnerable groups in education and employment opportunities, including vocational training and part-time employment for individuals with disabilities or caregiving responsibilities.
- Enhanced community cohesion through cultural exchange programs and anti-xenophobia campaigns.

Despite significant progress, challenges remain in addressing economic vulnerabilities, legal status issues, and the lack of accessible information, particularly for marginalized groups including refugees living in the left bank of the Dniestr River. Moving forward, humanitarian partners and Moldovan authorities must focus on improving accessibility to services ensuring action are taken to be more effective in reaching at-risk groups.
