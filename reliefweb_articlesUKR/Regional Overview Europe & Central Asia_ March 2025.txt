## **Germany:** Anti-extremism demonstrations surge ahead of tense elections

The final weeks of an unusually brief electoral campaign ahead of the snap 23 February federal elections in Germany were marked by a spike in political violence and heightened street mobilization. ACLED records at least seven targeted attacks on politicians’ and political parties’ properties and at least five acts of violence against candidates and election volunteers. This figure reflects ACLED data on the rising violence in the run-up to elections as well as the overall increase in violence against politicians in Germany. Meanwhile, on 13 February, an asylum seeker drove into a labor demonstration in Munich, killing three and injuring 39 people. Shortly after, on 21 February, another refugee stabbed a Spanish tourist at the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin. While Germany was not the only European country affected by such attacks — similar incidents also occurred in Austria and France in February — these episodes further fuelled political polarization and kept migration policy at the top of the political debate.

In response to the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) alliance enlisting the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) to float plans for a tougher immigration policy, demonstrations against the far-right surged in late January and continued into February. ACLED records over 300 mostly peaceful demonstrations in opposition to right-wing extremism and the AfD — up by 170% from January. This makes February the month with the third-highest number of such demonstrations since the revelation of a far-right remigration plot in January 2024 spurred [countrywide mobilization](https://acleddata.com/2024/02/08/regional-overview-europe-central-asia-january-2024/). The largest rallies occurred in Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, and Stuttgart, gathering over 500,000 people combined. Notwithstanding, AfD doubled its support from the 2021 elections with a fifth of the vote to become the second-largest force in parliament.

## **Greece**: Train crash anniversary demonstrations result in violence

The second anniversary of the [Tempe rail disaster](https://acleddata.com/2023/04/06/regional-overview-europe-central-asia-march-2023/) on 28 February saw the largest demonstrations in the country since the Greek debt crisis a decade ago. They were also a follow-up to the [26 January demonstrations](https://acleddata.com/2025/02/06/europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-overview-february-2025/#keytrends2) under the slogan “I have no oxygen,” which were triggered by the leaked recording of a victim’s call to the emergency services. Labor unions called a nationwide general strike, with hundreds of demonstrations to demand justice and accountability taking place in Greece and abroad.

Although most gatherings unfolded peacefully, clashes erupted between some demonstrators and police in Athens, Heraklion, and Thessaloniki. In Athens, where up to 800,000 participants turned out on Syntagma square, police dispersed demonstrators abruptly after hooded youths hurled petrol bombs at police and tried to storm the barricades of the parliament building. The media reported excessive police force, while demonstrators accused police officers of having slow reactions to the rioting and using it as an excuse to disperse the otherwise peaceful crowd. Thirty-four demonstrators were admitted to hospitals, including a photojournalist who was hit in the head by a police stun grenade. Dozens more demonstrators reported minor injuries. After their dispersal, demonstrators attempted to return to the square, where clashes continued overnight.

Although the ruling New Democracy (ND) party was reelected with a strong mandate after the Tempe disaster, public resentment has been growing over a perceived government cover-up of the causes of the Tempe disaster and the slow pace of investigation, which has amplified the lack of trust in the judiciary and government. This growing resentment has coincided with notable acts of violence targeting the properties of ND members. In the week before and on the date of the Tempe anniversary, the offices of three ND members of parliament in Thessaloniki and Crete were targeted in property destruction attacks. In addition, on the eve of the demonstrations, the anarchist group Immediate Response Cells set off an explosive device at the office of an ND member of the European Parliament in Varkiza.

## **Russia**: Russian forces counter-attack in the Kursk region and Ukraine targets Russian oil infrastructure 

Despite a nearly 15% decrease in the number of battles fought over the Ukraine-held part of Russia’s Kursk region in February, both Russian and Ukrainian forces engaged in offensive operations. Ukrainian troops unsuccessfully attempted to improve their posture southeast of Sudzha while Russian units launched assaults west and northwest of the town and reached the border with Ukraine’s Sumy region. Ukrainian forces repelled Russian cross-border ground attacks into Sumy but lost one of their supply routes. Russian troops are now seemingly attempting to encircle the Ukrainian stronghold in the Kursk region around Malaya Loknya. Earlier in February, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy floated the idea of a territorial exchange as part of ceasefire negotiations with Russia.

Meanwhile, the number of Ukrainian drone strikes on Russia’s internationally recognized territory increased by a quarter compared with January, of which 94% affected border areas of the Begorod region adjacent to Ukraine’s Kharkiv and Sumy regions. The rest of the strikes again mostly targeted Russia’s oil and gas infrastructure, incapacitating a major oil refinery in the Ryazan region and an oil pumping station in the Krasnodar region, which was used to transfer around 80% of Kazakhstan’s oil exports. Furthermore, an explosion occurred in the engine room of the Koala oil tanker harbored in Ust-Luga port in the Leningrad region, raising suspicion of sabotage as the ship is believed to be involved in circumventing the G7 and Australia’s price cap on Russia’s oil. Similar incidents involving Russia’s “shadow fleet” have also occurred recently in the Mediterranean Sea.

## **Ukraine**: Russia advances slowly amid ongoing attacks on Ukraine’s gas and nuclear infrastructure

The advance of Russian forces slowed in February amid a 20% decrease in the number of battles compared to January. Russian forces still took control of 14 Ukrainian settlements, down from 31 in January, mostly in the Donetsk region, where they sought to reach the region’s western boundary after the fall of Velyka Novosilka and to envelop Pokrovsk from the south. Russia also claimed to have occupied Toretsk further north, which had been under assault since June 2024, though fighting in and near the town is ongoing. The possible loss of Toretsk opened speculation about a potential Russian offensive toward Kostiantynivka south of the Slovyansk-Kramatorsk urban sprawl in the northern part of the region. ACLED notes an increased risk for the remaining civilians in the Kramatorskyi district, where Russian daily bombardment killed at least 20 civilians — over half of the reported civilian fatalities in the region for the month.

Russia continued its deliberate strike campaign on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure throughout the month, damaging and destroying energy infrastructure across the country with a particular focus on disrupting natural gas production. On 11 and 20 February, Russian missile and drone strikes damaged natural gas facilities in the Poltava and Kharkiv regions, respectively — the two regions that host most of Ukraine’s natural gas production. Russia’s strikes on the industry since Ukraine’s cessation of Russian gas transit through its territory on 1 January have resulted in a 40% decline in domestic gas production.23 In addition, Russian forces destroyed a thermal power plant in Mykolaiv city and repeatedly targeted energy infrastructure in Odesa city and the surrounding region between 18 and 26 February. Another energy facility was struck in the Dnipropetrovsk region on 26 February. These strikes on energy infrastructure, compounded by about 18 gigawatts of Ukraine’s energy generation losses due to the Russian occupation since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, have exacerbated the energy crisis in the country despite the relatively mild cold season and mitigation efforts preventing extended blackouts.

The ongoing emphasis on targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure continues to augment the risk of a nuclear accident. The Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant is again on the verge of a blackout due to ongoing remote violence around it. On 14 February, a Russian attack drone pierced a protection shield over the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Kyiv region, starting a fire.
