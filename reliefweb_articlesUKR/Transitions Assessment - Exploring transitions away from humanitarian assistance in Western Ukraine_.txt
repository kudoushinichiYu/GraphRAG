Transitions Assessment - Exploring transitions away from humanitarian assistance in Western Ukraine: Case study of Volodymyrska and Chortkivska hromadas, February 2025 | Ukraine

**Context & Rationale**

As the needs of conflict-affected populations in Western and Central Ukraine became increasingly protracted and less acute, the 2024 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan (HNRP) has refocused its efforts on providing life-saving assistance in the South and East1. Consequently, humanitarian actors have begun scaling down aid programmes in the West and Centre. At the same time, initial discussions around transitioning away from humanitarian assistance underscored the importance of coordinating this process responsibly, ensuring that non-humanitarian systems and resources are equipped to address ongoing and often complex needs. As of January 2025 additional issues emerged due to a sudden and potentially long-term decline in funding for both humanitarian and development activities which further strengthens the need for sustainable transition to other forms of assistance. The HNRP 2025 aims to assist 6 million people out of the 12.7 million people in need (down from 8.5 million out of 14.6 million in 2024). It prioritises those with extreme and catastrophic needs, primarily living near the frontlines, as well as individuals with severe needs in areas experiencing pockets of crisis in Western and Central Ukraine. Additionally, the plan emphasises sustainable, long-term solutions by linking humanitarian activities with national mechanisms, complementing Ukraine’s social protection system, and prioritising the provision of essential services through governmental institutions where possible2.

Nonetheless, conflict-affected populations in Western and Central Ukraine continue to face chronic and often complex challenges that jeopardise their immediate well-being, longer-term resilience, and the country’s prospects for sustainable recovery. Although the pace of internal displacement has slowed down, as of October 2024, 3.6 million people remained internally displaced. Government-mandated evacuations from the Eastern and Northern regions further contribute to ongoing displacement3. As of December 2024, an estimated 591,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) resided in Western Ukraine4 (4% of whom were accommodated in collective sites5), adding to the region’s population needs, despite it being less directly affected by hostilities. Other vulnerable groups, such as older people, people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, and households with children (particularly single-caregiver households), face compounded challenges, including health, psychosocial and livelihoods issues. The war has also brought significant damage to civilian and critical infrastructure6 and despite some recovery in 2023–2024, the Ukrainian economy and livelihoods remain deeply impacted by the war7. Amid these challenges, addressing the needs of conflict-affected populations poses challenges to local governments, NGOs, and service providers, many of whom are operating beyond their capacity.

Relying on a case study of Volodymyrska (Volynska oblast) and Chortkivska (Ternopilska oblast) hromadas, this assessment aims to inform humanitarian and transitional policy discussions by exploring how and to what extent the ongoing protection, Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) and shelter-related needs of conflict-affected people are being met at the local level, in the context of the humanitarian assistance scale-down. Additionally, the assessment evaluates the process of transition, examining whether it is systematic, coordinated and sustainable.

**Key Messages**

• The primary barrier to effective service provision is insufficient funding, amid the withdrawal of humanitarian actors from the West and strained local economy. This gap, combined with workforce shortages due to displacement and mobilisation, has reduced the capacity of local governments to deliver services.

• Effective cross-stakeholder cooperation is crucial for service provision, but it requires strong coordination and transparent information sharing among stakeholders and with the affected population.

• The transition process could benefit from greater transparency and improved communication at the local level, while efforts have been focused on the regional level. NGOs and IOs have primarily informed their beneficiaries and partners directly, often passing only the most severe cases to local providers as they scale down activities.

• The transition has disproportionately affected those with war-related needs, particularly IDPs, while other vulnerable groups (e.g., older people, single caregivers, and individuals with disabilities or chronic illnesses) also face worsening conditions as humanitarian aid diminishes.
