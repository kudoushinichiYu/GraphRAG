Three years into Ukraine war, one third of population in frontline regions struggle to find enough to eat

KYIV, Ukraine — As the war in Ukraine enters its fourth year, an estimated five million Ukrainians are facing food insecurity, with the greatest needs concentrated in areas near the frontlines. According to data collected by the UN World Food Programme (WFP), millions of people are resorting to coping mechanisms, sacrificing their own meals so their children can eat. Others are going into debt to buy sufficient food supplies to feed their families.

WFP continues to provide food and cash assistance to nearly 1.5 million Ukrainians each month, mostly in the frontline regions. Despite these efforts, more than half of the people in the Kherson region in the south face severe hunger, and, two out of every five individuals face hunger in Zaporizhzhia as well as the Donetsk region in the east.

"Families in frontline regions are struggling to put food on the table, forcing them to make heartbreaking choices just to get by," said Richard Ragan, WFP Country Director in Ukraine. “As we look forward to sustainable peace in what is considered to be one of the world’s historical breadbasket regions, we must face the reality that humanitarian aid continues to be a lifeline for millions.”

According to WFP monitoring, 72 percent of those who receive food assistance reported having to cut back on food, buy less nutritious food, skip meals, or borrow money to feed their family. Across six frontline regions almost a third of all people are food insecure.

In areas close to the war, commercial supply chains are disrupted, infrastructure is often damaged or destroyed, and the opportunities to earn money are scarce. Where supermarkets are accessible and stocked, many families cannot afford nutritious food. The cost of basic food items rose by 25 percent in the last year, with some staple vegetables more than doubling in price.

Since March 2022, WFP has provided assistance in Ukraine equivalent to 3.3 billion meals and distributed 445,000 metric tons of food.

Meanwhile, the challenges of delivering lifesaving assistance near the frontlines have been growing. In the last six months, WFP food distribution points and the vehicles or assets of its local humanitarian partners have been hit by drones, shelling or missiles more than 20 times, putting humanitarian operations at risk.
