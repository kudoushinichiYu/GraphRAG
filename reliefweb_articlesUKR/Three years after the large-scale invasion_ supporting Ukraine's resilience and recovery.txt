Three years after the large-scale invasion: supporting Ukraine's resilience and recovery

**Since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Cordaid has supported Ukrainians by providing humanitarian assistance and strengthening resilience through impactful partnerships with local Caritas organisations.**

By late 2024, over 3.7 million people remained displaced within Ukraine, with 6 million more seeking refuge abroad. The war’s impact on housing, infrastructure, and mental health has created urgent needs.

An increasing number of families are coping with the loss of loved ones, particularly husbands, sons, and fathers, while demobilised veterans face significant challenges in reintegrating into society.

Following the large-scale invasion, [Ukrainian Caritas partners](https://www.caritas.eu/caritas-ukraine/) rapidly mobilised to deliver emergency assistance to conflict-affected regions across the country. They have supported almost 5 million people in need since then.

Cordaid funds Caritas Ukraine’s projects through [Giro555](http://giro555.nl/), a national campaign that raised one of the largest sums in its history in March 2022.

**Key initiatives include:**

- Emergency Relief: Supporting displaced people in fragile and vulnerable circumstances in war-affected areas in the east with basic needs.
- Water Rehabilitation: Repairing damaged water systems and installing filtration units in heavily affected areas to ensure access to clean water.
- Healthcare Programmes: Establishing eight medical centres that provide integrated services, including primary healthcare, psychological support, and palliative care. These centres are designed to achieve financial sustainability through government support.
- Livelihood Recovery: Helping displaced people rebuild their lives through business training and start-up grants.
- Palliative Care Expansion: Meeting the rising demand for home and hospice care for displaced elderly and chronically ill, impacted by ongoing conflict.

As in many conflicts, those in vulnerable situations suffer the most. In Ukraine, thousands of elderly people fled the eastern regions with their families, only for the younger generations to continue their search for safety abroad. Many elderly people remain behind, often struggling to survive alone and relying on aid organisations for support.

## **Genuine Kindness**

Take 76-year-old Petro Hryhorovych from Kherson. ‘My two daughters are in Poland. I have a son in Russia and one in Canada. They do call me. But today is a hard day—it’s been a whole year since I lost my wife, Lyubochka,’ Petro says, fighting back tears. ‘If only there were no war. What did we ever do to them? We lived through bombings and gas cuts. We had no heating. Then she had a heart attack.’

Petro vividly recalls the traumatic journey after these tragic events. ‘First, volunteers took me to Odesa, where I spent a month in an infectious disease hospital—I had a bacterial infection in my right leg, and they had to amputate it. Then they brought me here. I didn’t even know where I was going. But the staff and the nurses are incredible. I’ve never met such kind people. When I arrived here, I felt worthless. Now, I feel human again. This place is my home. I wish to take my last breath here.’

After learning that the medical centre is also funded by Dutch citizens, Petro tears up again. ‘I hope people in the Netherlands never experience this kind of sorrow. Yet, they help others who do. That’s genuine kindness. I used to pray for my people, and now I will also pray for people in the Netherlands.’

## **Coping with Extreme Trauma**

In a former military complex in the forest outside Drohobych, Caritas runs the Nazareth Centre, providing support to around 140 people, including war veterans struggling with addiction, displaced families, and individuals with severe injuries or illnesses.

The veterans, many of whom have experienced profound trauma, participate in therapeutic sessions to share their stories and work through their experiences.

‘I spent a year fighting. Going back home was very difficult for me, and I started using drugs,’ says 27-year-old veteran Roman during a session at the Nazareth Centre. ‘When fighting in a war, you live in a different reality. When you come home, you can’t relate to that reality anymore. I didn’t see a way out. I felt my life slipping away.’

After numerous well-intentioned efforts by friends and family, it became clear that Roman needed professional psychosocial intervention, which Caritas in Drohobych could provide. ‘Slowly, they started pulling me out of this black hole. They took my hand and led the way. I could never have done this by myself. Here, I find spiritual guidance. It fulfils me. My hope is growing. I have post-traumatic stress disorder, but I’m learning what trauma is and how to live again.’

The Nazareth Centre also provides refuge to displaced families. After losing their home and almost all their belongings, Olia and her four children fled the Dnipro region. ‘We had nowhere to go. Caritas welcomed us and made us part of the community. I want people to hear my story so they can feel less afraid. I thought there was no help available, but when I arrived here, I realised there are people who will give you food and a roof over your head,’ says Olia.

## **Resilience and Self-Reliance**

When an emergency persists for years, humanitarian organisations must adapt their programmes to address the long-term needs of the population. Beyond providing immediate assistance, such as food, water, and shelter, they also focus on strengthening people’s resilience and self-reliance through economic empowerment.

Oleksandr Manevych runs an insulation panel business in an old factory outside Lviv and participates in Caritas Ukraine’s REMARKET programme. The initiative aims to enhance business operations and income opportunities for 150 micro, small, and medium enterprises owned by internally displaced persons, returnees, and members of host communities.

‘I am from Mykolaiv. Since 1993, I have worked in construction, creating insulation materials. Before the invasion, my market was in Russia. We developed our cost-effective product for a broad audience. Our customers include kindergartens and hospitals. In Mykolaiv, a missile hit the hospital, and my panels were used for the staircase. Everything burned down—only the walls with my panels remained standing.’

Now employing twelve people in Lviv, Oleksandr has made remarkable progress in rebuilding his business but faces challenges securing new orders. ‘Marketing is the most difficult part; how do you get people to know you in a new region? We are putting our hearts and souls into this and are so proud of our product. I’m convinced a high-quality product like this will reach the market.’

As the conflict continues, Cordaid and Caritas remain committed to a dual emergency relief approach and sustainable recovery that considers new needs. By strengthening partnerships with the Ukrainian Caritas branches and other local organisations, fostering local leadership, and ensuring financial sustainability, we aim to build resilience and restore hope for the millions affected by this devastating war.
