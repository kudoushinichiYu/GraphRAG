More than 127.000 Ukrainian refugees accompanied by the Jesuits since the war started

*Three years of unwavering solidarity: Emergency aid, shelter, education, and integration services offered through the One Proposal initiative*

The Society of Jesus has served 127.528 people fleeing violence in the three years since the war in [**Ukraine**](https://jrs.net/en/country/ukraine/) started. Coordinated by JRS Europe and the Xavier Network, in collaboration with NGOs and local partners, the Jesuits has provided 612.606 individual services including emergency aid, shelter, psychosocial support, education, and integration, among other services, through the One Proposal.

Alberto Ares Mateos SJ, JRS Europe regional director, expresses: “As another grim milestone passes and some decision makers are wavering in their support, our commitment to continue accompanying those forcibly displaced by this war remains as steady as the first day. We will continue to do our best to support those displaced in Ukraine, in neighbouring countries and across the continent.”

“Even in a context marked by pain, stress and uncertainty, we see that hope still is alive. We see every day examples of solidarity and integration. In other words, we see brothers and sisters extending a helping hand to each other and walking together. We are immensely thankful to the continuous solidarity of many generous people, foundations and organizations who trust in the work of the Society of Jesus”.

Jesuit organizations have provided 612.606 individual services, complementing through multiple services to each person to ensure a holistic approach that best supports those who need it most. These services include shelter, mental health, legal assistance, education, social inclusion through work, as well as the provision of food or medical items.

As the crisis continued and the needs of people evolved, the response was continuously expanded and adapted. Based on surveys and interviews, the services shifted from more than half aimed at short-term and emergency aid in 2022, to almost 8 out of 10 being aimed at medium- and long-term support in 2024.

## **About the One Proposal**

The One Proposal, which was presented in July 2022 after an in-depth needs assessment, encompasses a wide range of services to be provided to an originally projected 73,168 people over the course of 3 years. Since then, it has been continuously revised and expanded with yearly needs assessments.

It addresses the needs of forcibly displaced Ukrainians across Europe, from immediate humanitarian response and emergency assistance in Ukraine and its neighbours to long-term programmes to promote and integrate refugees. Therefore, it will benefit internally displaced people, refugees of Ukrainian nationality and refugees of other nationalities, displaced by the conflict in Ukraine.
