Analysis of Frontline Hromadas - NRC Ukraine Cash Team, March 2025: Week 1

The analysis, requested by members of the Cash Working Group, aims to support strategic planning and operational activities. By quickly identifying Hromadas located in close proximity to the frontline, more efficient and effective coordi- nation can occur within the wider response.

The analysis employs spatial data to calculate the intersection percentages of Hromadas with predefined buffer zones around conflict areas. Geographic Information System (GIS) tools are utilized to overlay Hromada boundaries within buffer zones at 5km, 15km, 20km, 30km, and 50km distances from the front- line. The results are presented as color-coded maps, yellow high coverage vs. purple low coverage, indicating the extent of intersection as a percentage of the total area of each Hromada. It is important to note that this analysis is based on the most recent data available from sources such as public ArcGIS maps and OCHA shapefile datasets. However, as the situation on the ground is fluid and constantly evolving, all findings should be corroborated with relevant governmental authorities to ensure accuracy and reflect the current realities.
