Ukraine Situation/Romania: Iași Site Assessment Factsheet, September 2024 [EN/RO]

**Collective Accommodation Site Assessment**

From February 24, 2022, to August 31, 2024, millions of refugees have fled Ukraine, with 6,900,866 entering Romania. Approximately 177,000 of these refugees have registered for Temporary Protection or similar national protection schemes in the country. To address their immediate needs, particularly for accommodation, the Romanian Government, in collaboration with civil society and local authorities, established several collective centers nationwide.  

To monitor the situation and identify the needs of these centers, the Romanian Department for Emergency Situations (DSU), UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, together with the General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations (IGSU), through the county level inspectorates for emergency situations (ISU), and the Center for the Comparative Study of Migration (CSCM) developed a Site Assessment tool to gain insight into the operational status and needs of collective centers, and to support data-driven decision-making for future longer-term accommodation solutions.  

This factsheet summarizes the aggregated findings from the assessment applied in the ”Centrul de Asistenta Umanitara si Sociala Nicolina” Iași Center. The data presented is indicative of the situation in the monitored site at the time of data collection. The purpose of this factsheet is to provide focused information on the conditions, challenges and opportunities in the collective center. It serves as a reference for central and local authorities, international organizations, NGOs, and other stakeholders, offering insights into the ongoing needs and issues faced by these centers.
