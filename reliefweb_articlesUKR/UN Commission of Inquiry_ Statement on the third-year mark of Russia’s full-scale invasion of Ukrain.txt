UN Commission of Inquiry: Statement on the third-year mark of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine [EN/UK]

**VIENNA** - As the armed conflict resulting from the Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth year, it is crucial that the international community continues its efforts to pursue accountability and justice as part of discussions on peace talks.

The conflict has led to thousands of deaths and even larger number of injuries, to the destruction or damage to homes and infrastructure essential to people's lives.

For almost three years, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine has been documenting violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, as well as their devastating impact on victims, their families and their communities. In addition to the many physical injuries that will need time to heal, the deep psychological impact will have long lasting effects on all persons, including children, regardless of background and age.

In its last report of October 2024, submitted to the General Assembly, the Commission found that the Russian authorities have committed torture as a crime against humanity.

In addition, in its various reports, the Commission has found a wide array of violations of human rights and international law, as well as related crimes, committed by Russian authorities. These include wilful killings, enforced disappearances, attacks on civilians, unlawful confinement, rape and sexual violence, forced transfer and deportation of children, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, attacks on energy infrastructure, as well as the destruction or transfer of cultural objects.

The Commission has also documented some violations committed by Ukrainian authorities, including against persons suspected of collaboration.

The third-year mark of the Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion is a reminder that one of the primary conditions for the stability of peace agreements is the ownership of what has been agreed by the parties to the conflict. At this juncture, it is critically important for the international community, while supporting peace initiatives, to pursue its efforts to ensure accountability, justice and lasting peace. Experience shows that sustainable peace is not achieved by sacrificing existing international legal obligations, in particular the victims’ right to justice.

The Commission has consistently promoted a broad notion of accountability. It has emphasized the importance of investigating all violations and crimes and of holding perpetrators, including commanders and other superiors, accountable.

But in addition to criminal prosecutions, non-judicial accountability plays a critical role in addressing the broader impacts of the conflict. These include truth-seeking initiatives, reparations for victims, and guarantees of non-repetition. They are essential for the rehabilitation process of the victims and their families. Moreover, they help mitigate the consequences of violations, strengthen social cohesion, and contribute to institutional trust.

The Commission has also recommended that national, regional and international accountability mechanisms, judicial and non-judicial, be coordinated to achieve meaningful results.

Judicial and non-judicial accountability measures help to make peace efforts sustainable. They also call for a peace process that is inclusive and allows for the meaningful participation of different groups and communities. Adhering to these principles is a legitimate response to victims’ sense of justice, which they consistently expressed in their testimony to the Commission.
