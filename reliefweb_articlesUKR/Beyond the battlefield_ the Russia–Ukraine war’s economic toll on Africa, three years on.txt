Beyond the battlefield: the Russia–Ukraine war’s economic toll on Africa, three years on

Three years on from the onset of the Russia–Ukraine war, the world remains gripped by geopolitical uncertainty, and its economic fallout continues to reverberate across the globe. This ongoing economic uncertainty threatens economic growth, particularly in nations with limited financial buffers to withstand external shocks, including many in Africa.

Although the price shocks – in fuel, food and fertiliser – have subsided somewhat, they appear to be stabilising at higher levels compared to the pre-COVID-19 trends (Figure 1). Global inflation has been slowing down since late 2022 but remains high in low-income countries (Figure 2). These lingering price pressures, combined with growing risks of trade protectionism, mean the economic pain could continue.

Since the conflict’s onset, ODI Global has analysed its [**impacts on low-income and lower-middle income economies in sub-Saharan Africa**](https://odi.org/en/publications/impact-of-the-russia-ukraine-war-on-africa-policy-implications-for-navigating-shocks-and-building-resilience/). Our research reveals that the shocks have been multifaceted and, in some cases, long-lasting. The economic and financial pathways from the price shocks stemming from volatile fuel, food and fertiliser prices are now compounded by the persistent and broad-based strength of the US dollar, which has appreciated significantly in trade-weighted terms. This dollar dominance could fuel further inflation in some African economies.

While some economies have managed to mitigate the economic impact of the conflict, low-income countries with weaker buffers and less resilience against shocks continue to feel the long-term reverberations. The channels and magnitude of impacts differ depending on country structures, but our research series highlights several key findings that have policy implications for African countries:

- **Commodity and primary goods price shocks are multifaceted and can be long-lived.** While declining oil prices have boosted growth in some economies, in some instances in the past, they have triggered a sharp decline in GDP per capita for key African resource producers. Similarly, the effects of rising food and fuel prices vary depending on a household’s economic position. Higher primary goods prices can increase costs for importers and disproportionately harm low-income households, often with gender-differentiated impacts in resource-based low-income countries where gender gaps in education, income and wages already exist.
- **Adverse initial conditions exacerbate shocks**, **particularly unsustainable debt burdens**. Global debt was already on an increasing trend, especially in 2020, as governments needed financing for their COVID-19 rescue packages. However, continued global uncertainty over the Russia-Ukraine war, tightening financial conditions, and increased borrowing costs have raised debt sustainability risks in some low-income and middle-income countries. The proportion of these countries at high risk of and in debt distress has doubled from 27% in 2015 to 54% as of September 2024 ([**World Bank, 2024**](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/f1700aa0-cc73-42b7-8ceb-630c5528a574)). This narrowed fiscal space comes at the expense of lower financing for public investment and social spending, failing to mitigate and potentially compounding the economic and human capital scarring effects of successive shocks. For instance, between 2020 and 2022, 46 and 15 developing countries spent more public resources on debt interest payments than on health and education, respectively ([**UNCTAD, 2024**](https://unctad.org/publication/world-of-debt)).
- **Socially restrictive gender norms exacerbate the impact of shocks.** Gendered labour markets and weak social protection often result in women’s exclusion from male-dominated sectors with high job benefits. This, coupled with women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid care work, can exacerbate the shock of higher prices on disposable incomes. Higher input prices of primary goods can exacerbate hardship for importers and low-income households. Gender inequality and women’s welfare were already hurt by COVID-19 through disproportionate negative impact on income, unemployment, unpaid work and access to public services, and were further negatively affected by the gender gap in food insecurity and access to modern energy during the Russia-Ukraine war ([**UN Women, 2022**](https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2022-09/Policy-paper-Global-gendered-impacts-of-the-Ukraine-crisis-en.pdf)).
- \*\*Policies that build resilience are now critical, and must be gender-sensitive.\*\*Targeted policy levers are essential, both to mitigate the immediate effects of the shocks and to address the underlying structural vulnerabilities that amplify them. These could include price subsidies, a reframing of bank regulations and prioritising long-term capital inflows to address external imbalances. Given the existing gender disparities in many low-income African economies – where women often face greater resource scarcity, malnutrition, lower education levels and heavier workloads relative to men – monetary and fiscal policies must prioritise building resilience mechanisms, with a specific focus on gender equality. [**In a recent report**](https://odi.org/en/publications/gender-sensitive-macroeconomic-policies-in-low-and-middle-income-economies/), we argue that this requires a paradigm shift in gender-sensitive macroeconomic policy.

Economic, geopolitical and policy shocks are likely to persist, manifesting in new ways through various transmission channels. With a new US administration in place, Africa’s existing financial buffers and institutional mechanisms will hold a number of its economies in good stead. However, inflationary pressures could resurface due to trade and supply chain disruptions, coupled with recent exchange rate deprecations. A ceasefire in the Russia–Ukraine war could bring some economic relief through a the resumption of trade, though this could be offset by broader global trade tensions.

The cumulative long-term effects of a potential “peace dividend” from the war could prove economically significant. However, the broader-based risks of deglobalisation and trade fragmentation have intensified significantly since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Therefore, understanding shock transmission mechanisms and prioritising resilience as a cornerstone of economic policy is paramount for low- and middle-income economies in Africa. The path to recovery requires a multi-pronged approach, including targeted support for vulnerable populations, debt relief and transformative and sustainable investments. ODI Global continues to monitor global developments and explore how the lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war can build African resilience against future shocks.
