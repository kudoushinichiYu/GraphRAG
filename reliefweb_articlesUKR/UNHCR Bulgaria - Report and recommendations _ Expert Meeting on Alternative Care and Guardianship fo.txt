UNHCR Bulgaria - Report and recommendations | Expert Meeting on Alternative Care and Guardianship for Unaccompanied and Separated Children (UASC) in Bulgaria (January 2025)

**BACKGROUND**

On 23 October 2024, UNHCR in collaboration with its partner Bulgarian Helsinki Committee (BHC) convened an expert meeting on Alternative care and Guardianship for unaccompanied and separated children in Bulgaria, intended as part of annual UNHCR consultations with civil society, service providers and communities. The purpose was to take stock of the existing challenges and provide recommendations on how to address them, taking into account the opportunities for legislative and police changes arising in the context of the implementation of the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, as well as access to funding opportunities so as to ensure children have access to reception and care withing the national child protection system.

In total, 35 representatives of residential care services accommodating children seeking or granted international protection including Ruse, Burgas, Pazardzhik, Lesichovo and Sofia, the municipalities which are in charge of commissioning services on their territory, the State Agency for Refugees, the State Agency for Child Protection, the National Bureau for Legal Aid, the National Foster Care association, IOM, UNICEF, the Bulgarian Red Cross (BRC), and NGOs providing legal and social assistance – SOS for Children Villages, Foundation to Access Rights (FAR), BHC, and the Council of Refugee Women in Bulgaria (CRWB) took part in the meeting.

In welcoming the participants, UNHCR praised the commitment of the participants to child protection in an environment where political and social dedication to human rights of forcibly displaced and stateless persons are declining while armed conflict and displacement is rising around Bulgaria. UNHCR considered the belief that Bulgaria is a transit country as a challenge to child protection, underlining that Bulgaria is a country where children at risk, including unaccompanied and separated children, find the care and protection they deserve, and are entitled under European human rights law and EU standards. While there is much to be done to improve the reception and protection of UASC as long as their stay in Bulgaria, a common understanding and commitment to the principle is a big first step. Referring to the findings and recommendations of the Special Representative of the Secretary General of the Council of Europe on migration and refugees in 2023 and the Roundtable on alternative care and guardianship in April 2024, as well as the series of events on response to the vulnerabilities of UASC organised by UNHCR in collaboration with the EU Asylum Agency and the Greek Ministry of Migration and Asylum in July 2024, collective thinking by experts provides an opportunity to find new solutions to old challenges, as well as looking at those challenges from new angles.

The recommendations that the experts participating in this event identified should also inform the national implementation of the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum with regards to child protection. In this respect, UNHCR has made several comments and recommendations for the national implementation process.

These include, in particular:

- introducing robust identification mechanisms for UASC and other children at risk, including those with disabilities, victims of trafficking, those at risk of trafficking, and those experiencing trauma, at the earliest possible stage and ensuring they have effective access to services.
- introducing provision for the appointment of a guardian as soon as possible to protect the child’s rights, in addition to a legal representative for the purposes of legal procedures. This framework should also include professional guardians who are trained,establishing an independent guardian institution to recruit, train, appoint, and monitor guardians for UASC and a supervisory mechanism to monitor the performance of tasks of representatives and review complaints from unaccompanied minors and ensure they are equipped with the necessary resources.
- ensuring that adequate resources are allocated for family-based care arrangements (and supervised independent living arrangements when appropriate), and that inclusion of UASC into the national child protection system be prioritized, strengthened and collaborate with UNHCR to monitor alternative care standards. Cooperate with UNHCR, municipalities and child protection NGOs to enhance the national capacity of supervised independent living arrangements, including by allocating resources for this purpose;
- introducing procedures to consistently assess the best interest of the child from the moment of arrival and allocate the necessary financial and administrative resources to support the effective functioning of these procedures. The responsible institution of conducting with best interested procedure are child protection departments. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary for the guarantee that the best interest of UASC is respected.
