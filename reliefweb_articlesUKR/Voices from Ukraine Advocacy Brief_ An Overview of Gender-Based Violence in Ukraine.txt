Voices from Ukraine Advocacy Brief: An Overview of Gender-Based Violence in Ukraine

Entering its fourth year following the full-scale invasion in 2022, the ongoing war in Ukraine is characterized by growing humanitarian needs and protection concerns, with women and girls and other at-risk groups critically affected. In 2024, Ukraine faced an escalation in hostilities, with civilian casualties on the rise and widespread destruction of vital civilian infrastructure impacting essential services. The insecurity, prolonged displacement, and economic deterioration have placed a strain on household resources, reducing the coping capacities of women and girls and other marginalized groups in Ukraine and further exposing them to risks of gender-based violence (GBV).

The ongoing war in Ukraine contributes to new forms of GBV and greatly exacerbates pre-existing ones, increasing the violence faced by women and girls while reducing their resilience and hindering survivorsâ€™ access to support. Women and girls face escalating levels of violence in the home, while also feeling more insecure and experiencing heightened risks outside of the home.

The ***Voices from Ukraine*** Advocacy Brief amplifies the diverse voices of women and girls and provides a snapshot of GBV in Ukraine. It offers a closer look at the daily experiences and risks faced by women and girls in Ukraine and provides an overview of GBV trends. It outlines a series of recommendations for donors and policymakers, humanitarian sectors, and GBV actors to inform evidence-based humanitarian response. The brief urgently calls for increased investment in targeted GBV programming, including specialized services for survivors, along with a stronger focus on mitigating GBV risks and reducing access barriers within humanitarian interventions. It highlights the critical need for expanded and coordinated efforts to support women and girls in Ukraine and prevent, mitigate risks of, and respond to GBV.
