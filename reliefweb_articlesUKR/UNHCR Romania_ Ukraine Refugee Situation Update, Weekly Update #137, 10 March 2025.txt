**Highlights**

On 7 March, UNHCR Romania received a generous contribution of US$ 450,000 from the Government of Japan to support the socio-economic inclusion of refugees from Ukraine. This funding will enable personalized job coaching, counselling, and employment programmes, helping refugees achieve self-reliance and economic independence. It will also offer opportunities for refugees to learn how to start a business and participate in a competition for grants to turn their business plans into reality in Romania.

On 8 March, as part of International Women’s Day commemoration, UNHCR Romania issued a web-story of a Ukrainian painter that is using her knowledge and skills to address trauma and anxiety of women and children in Constanta. Through inspiring stories such as the one of Oleksandra, UNHCR wants to raise awareness of the importance of mental health and psychosocial support for refugees from Ukraine in Romania.

**Humanitarian Response and Advocacy**

On International Women’s Day, various events across Romania celebrated the strength, resilience, and empowerment of refugee women. In Constanta, 39 participants attended an event hosted by UNHCR and Sensiblu, where women from Ukraine and Romania shared experiences on leadership and empowerment, marking the conclusion of Women Empowerment Week with activities like film screenings and health awareness. At the Emergency Transit Centre in Timisoara, 12 refugees from Niger, Yemen, and Syria participated in talks on womanhood, digital skills training, and research on female role models boosting their confidence and sense of resilience. At the AIDRom Multifunctional Centre in Timisoara, some 20 women gathered to cook, shared stories and connected, while a support group of Ukrainian women created festive art and discussed emotional resilience, fostering a sense of community and support. In Suceava, local associations and refugee-led organizations gathered 39 women from the Ukrainian community, celebrating with inspirational games, sweets, and flowers. These events provided vital skills, emotional support, and a renewed sense of belonging, demonstrating the power of community and shared strength.

Since the beginning of 2025, UNHCR together with partners have distributed 21,649 core-relief items (CRIs) to 5,700 refugees and host community members in Romania, including hygiene kits, blankets, mattresses, and clothing. The assistance has met immediate needs, improved living conditions, reduced stress and eased financial burdens. UNHCR's Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) programme found that CRIs support effectively addressed urgent needs, reduced daily pressures, and eased financial burdens. This allowed families to allocate resources to other critical needs, promoting long-term resilience, self-reliance, and improved well-being. Expanding the CRIs distribution to Romanian host communities in need, further aims to foster cohesion.
