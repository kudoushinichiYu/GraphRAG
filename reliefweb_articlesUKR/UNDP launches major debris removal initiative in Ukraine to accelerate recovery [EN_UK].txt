UNDP launches major debris removal initiative in Ukraine to accelerate recovery [EN/UK]

*Debris management activities expand to eight regions across Ukraine, alongside equipment provision, enhancing safety and accelerating reconstruction.*

**Kyiv, 25 February 2025** – The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine, with support from the Governments of Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the MPTF Ukraine Community Recovery Fund, is set to launch one of its largest debris removal initiatives globally.

According to the current [assessment](https://www.undp.org/ukraine/press-releases/updated-damage-assessment-finds-524-billion-needed-recovery-ukraine-over-next-decade), 13% of Ukraine’s total housing stock has been damaged or destroyed (affecting over 2.5 million households). The cost of debris clearance and management (and demolition where needed) reaches around US$13 billion.

The project will span eight regions of Ukraine, targeting priority sites for debris clearance, including destroyed private houses, multi-storey buildings, schools, hospitals, and other infrastructure.

This initiative will also create over 350 job opportunities, supporting economic recovery.Debris removal and demolition operations have already started in Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Mykolaiv regions at the previous stages, but also will soon expand to Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, and Kherson regions, as well as the cities of Sumy and Kharkiv.

Preparatory work is currently underway to ensure all operations align with "safety first" principles.

Currently, extensive non-technical surveys are being conducted across the target communities to ensure work sites are free from mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO). These surveys are essential for the safety of workers and residents and must be completed before debris removal can begin. As of mid-February 2025, more than 260 sites had already been surveyed.

To further enhance safety and minimize risks, all personnel involved in debris removal operations are undergoing comprehensive training. This includes trainings on hazardous and asbestos-containing materials, explosive ordnance risk education, and Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA).

So far, 48 personnel, including debris removal staff, managers, and engineers, have been trained to manage hazards and minimize risks. The trainings were held in Train-the-Trainer (ToT) mode, enhancing the efficiency by enabling first 2 groups of participants spread the knowledge to a larger team.

**Masashi Nakagome, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to Ukraine**, underscored that Japan remains unwavering in its commitment to standing with Ukraine.

“With UNDP as our trusted partner in Ukraine’s recovery, we are honored to support its largest-ever debris removal initiative in the country, bringing our resources to help restore communities, “ Nakagome said. “Having faced significant challenges from natural disasters, Japan recognizes the critical importance of effective debris management in recovery and rebuilding efforts.”

**Park Kichang, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Ukraine**, reaffirmed Korea’s dedication to Ukraine’s recovery. “Our recent contribution to UNDP for early recovery and area-based development projects reflects our commitment to restoring livelihoods and rebuilding communities," said Park. He also emphasized Korea's long-term support, highlighting the Ukraine Peace and Solidarity Initiative, stating: “Through this initiative, we are committed to providing comprehensive assistance — ranging from national security and humanitarian aid to reconstruction efforts — ensuring sustainable progress for the Ukrainian people.”

**Jaco Cilliers, UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine**, emphasized that UNDP remains at the forefront of debris management efforts in Ukraine. “Since 2022, UNDP has facilitated the removal of 400,000 tons of debris from 89 cities and villages across four regions,” said Cilliers. “With support from the Governments of Japan and the Republic of Korea, we are significantly expanding our efforts. Building on our experience, UNDP is also helping Ukraine develop a sustainable, EU-aligned debris management system through stronger policies, local capacity building, and cross-sector collaboration.”

**Nataliia Kozlovska, Deputy Minister for Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine,** emphasized the overwhelming challenges Ukraine is facing due to the scale of destruction caused by the ongoing conflict.

“The volume of debris across Ukraine is unprecedented, a challenge no country could have fully prepared for,” Kozlovska said. “The presence of hazardous materials like asbestos and unexploded ordnance further complicates efforts. We deeply appreciate the support of UNDP, Japan, and the Republic of Korea for helping Ukraine overcome these challenges, with safety as the top priority.”

**Background:**

UNDP is leading the development of a comprehensive and unified approach to effective debris management that is specifically tailored to Ukraine’s unique context. This involves establishing robust legal frameworks, setting best practices for effective debris removal, and empowering local communities to manage and clear accumulated debris efficiently. Key priorities include mitigating risks associated with asbestos-containing materials and promoting sustainable debris recycling and reuse practices.
