Disability & Age Task Force - Refugee Coordination Forum Moldova - Disability Briefing Note (March 2025) [EN/RO/RU]

**BACKGROUND**  
 Three years have passed since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, forcing millions of Ukrainians to flee their homes. Moldova, a country with a population of 2.4 million people, has hosted the highest numbers of refugees per capita. As of March 2025, approximately 127,000 refugees from Ukraine remained in Moldova, with around 76,000 having received asylum, temporary protection, or residence status.

In 2024, from the Socio-Economic Insights Survey (SETS) conducted by the IMPACT Initiative 10% are refugees with disabilities, moreover, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) conducted protection monitoring interviews with 1,367 Ukrainian refugees in Moldova, of whom 12% were persons with disabilities identified through the Washington Group of Questions. This subgroup of refugees faces severe challenges in accessing services, employment, and maintaining their well-being. The majority of refugees surveyed by OHCHR (79%) were women, and a significant portion were older adults, with 30% aged 60-69 and 24% aged 70-79. The most reported difficulties were seeing (46%) and mobility (43%), while 20% experienced cognitive impairments. Mental health concerns were prevalent, with over 60% reporting anxiety and depression, and more than half facing untreated serious medical conditions due to healthcare access barriers.

Additionally, social listening activities by Laolalta's Info Unit captured sentiments from refugees with disabilities, reflecting struggles with inclusion, accessibility, and financial security. One refugee shared: "I arrived in Moldova alone, as my family stayed in Ukraine. The staff of Motivatie (a DATF members) has supported me emotionally and helped me pursue online courses to find employment." Another older refugee highlighted accessibility concerns: "It is difficult to get around; the streets and public transport are not designed for people like me." These accounts emphasize the need for targeted interventions to improve access to services, information, and social participation for those with disabilities.

This briefing note provides an overview of the situation of refugees with disabilities in Moldova, highlighting key results achieved in 2024 by Disability and Age Task Force members, persisting gaps, and recommendations for improving inclusion and support. Forced displacement can create or exacerbate disabilities, placing persons with disabilities among the most at-risk and disproportionately affected groups in these contexts.
