HSM: Distance from the frontline/border and impact on humanitarian needs (December 2024)

• Settlements closest to the frontline/border were more likely to have more severe multi- and sectoral needs. Additionally, settlements located in frontline oblasts generally face more severe multi- and sectoral needs than settlements in border oblasts, regardless of the distance from their frontline/border. However, this trend appears mostly limited to settlements within 0-50km as there are no discernible correlation between distance and multisectoral SVI scores for settlements within 51-100km1.

• Co-occurring sectoral needs were much more frequent, severe and complex in settlements within 0-50km than 51+km: residents of only 8% of settlements within 0-50km had no co-occurring needs identified (compared to 27% of residents in settlements 51+km); and residents in 28% of settlements within 0-50km faced an extreme or total inability to meet their needs across two or more sectors (compared to 5% of residents in settlements 51+km).

• Protection needs remained prevalent and severe across all settlements, regardless of the distance from the frontline/border. This contrasts with other sectors, where unmet needs were significantly more frequent in settlements within 0-50km compared to those 51-100km away, and the most severe needs were exclusively located in settlements 0-50km of the frontline/border.
