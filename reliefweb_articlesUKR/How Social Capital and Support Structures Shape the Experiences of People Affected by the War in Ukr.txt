How Social Capital and Support Structures Shape the Experiences of People Affected by the War in Ukraine: The Case of Ukraine, Poland, and Germany

The report presents the findings of a regional research project conducted by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) in Ukraine, Poland, and Germany between late May and mid-August 2024.

As the war in Ukraine enters its third year, gaining a comprehensive understanding of its impact beyond immediate humanitarian needs, becomes increasingly important. The conflict has triggered massive waves of internal and external displacement, as well as a significant number of refugees returning to Ukraine. These movements have been shaped by legal frameworks, such as the European Union’s (EU) Temporary Protection Directive and Ukraine’s simplified IDP registration process, as well as the varying levels of support across EU countries, influencing individuals’ mobility decisions.

The report explores the journeys of people affected by the war in Poland and Germany — the two EU countries hosting the largest Ukrainian refugee populations — as well as those who remained in or returned to Ukraine.

The presence of IRC operations in these countries enabled in-depth research, but the study also acknowledges the experiences of those who have not received direct support from the organization, ensuring a broader and more inclusive analysis.

The report examines the different types of support received by individuals affected by the war in Ukraine from close networks, aid organizations, and government institutions, identifying key needs, gaps in assistance, and how available resources influence decision-making.

By classifying similar experiences into common scenarios, the report highlights how individuals — despite vastly different living conditions — often share similar challenges, concerns, and aspirations.

This report serves as a resource for understanding both country-specific dynamics and the broader regional context, helping policymakers, humanitarian organizations, and stakeholders prepare for future developments that could shape the course of the war in Ukraine.
