WHO, UNICEF and the Government in Ukraine are working together in cross-sectoral collaboration to ensure drinking water safety for the Ukrainian people [EN/UK]

**Kyiv, 14 March** **2025** - On 12-13 March, the WHO Regional Office for Europe and the WHO in Ukraine, in collaboration with UNICEF in Ukraine, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, and key governmental stakeholders, held a National consultation on water safety planning in Kyiv.

**Dr Jarno Habicht**, WHO Representative in Ukraine, noted: *“Access to safe water is a fundamental human right and also a critical determinant of public health. The ongoing war has a devastating impact on water infrastructure. The country is facing severe damage to water supply networks and wastewater treatment plants. Many people in Ukraine are struggling to access clean water, compromising hygiene practices and sanitary conditions, altogether raising the risk of infectious diseases. In Mykolaiv, Dnipro, and Zaporizhzhia, the situation is particularly critical, and health risks are especially high. A number of humanitarian organizations and emergency programs are working tirelessly to address these urgent needs. And I believe that with a collective effort, strong partnerships, cross-sectoral collaboration, and coordinated support from the national and international partners, we can ensure safe and sustainable drinking water as a part of a broader strategy for health security and resilience”.*

According to the World Bank's Fourth Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment in Ukraine, before the war, approximately 70% of the population of Ukraine had access to the centralized water supply. The ongoing war in Ukraine has significantly exacerbated existing challenges in ensuring adequate access to safe drinking water, putting the health of the population at risk. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Cluster estimated that 9.6 million Ukrainians were in need of essential water supply and sanitation services in 2024. The total cost of reconstruction and rehabilitation is estimated at 11.3 billion USD for 2025-2033 (World Bank).

In order to build and maintain resilient drinking-water supply systems, safeguard sustainable access to safe water for all, and ensure that drinking water is safe and properly managed, this consultation brought together all stakeholders concerned with public health and water supply. It is aimed to support Ukraine’s efforts to develop a national Water Safety Planning (WSP) programme in line with the requirements of the European Union Drinking Water Directive (2020/2184) in preparation for Ukraine’s accession to the EU, and to guide defining priorities in recovery and inform future investments.

Water safety planning (WSP) is a comprehensive risk-based approach recommended by the WHO *Guidelines for drinking-water quality* as the most effective means of consistently ensuring the safety and adequacy of a drinking water supply. Successful implementation of WSPs can provide many benefits, including improved drinking-water quality, greater regulatory compliance, improved public health protection, and strengthened emergency preparedness and response. The WSP approach also provides a robust framework for targeted and sustainable investment and financing. The current challenges in Ukraine underscore the significant need for a risk-based approach to drinking-water in the current crisis context, and to support longer-term recovery.

**Mr Robb Butler**, Director of the Division of Communicable Diseases, Environment and Health at the WHO Regional Office for Europe, said: *“Adopting a risk-based approach is a core recommendation of the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality and, since 2020, a core pillar of the requirements of the EU Drinking Water Directive. At present, all European Union countries, as well as those in the process of accession, are adopting and scaling up a risk-based approach. It helps navigate emergencies, including the challenges of climate change, informs the prioritization of investment needs in the context of recovery efforts and guides priorities in public health surveillance.”*

In 2023, WHO supported a national awareness raising and capacity building workshop on risk-based approaches to safe drinking-water, during which the need for a national action plan (or “roadmap”) for the uptake of WSP in Ukraine was agreed. Further, national and international stakeholders were brought together to further the dialogue on WSP in the context of strengthening water, sanitation and hygiene in the time of crisis, and longer-term sustainable recovery. A Consensus statement was reached on the needs and future priorities to help ensure more resilient and sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene services in Ukraine to safeguard public health. During 2024, certain actions outlined in the Consensus statement have been implemented by WHO and other partners. These efforts have set the stage for further collaboration and progress for determining national priorities and the way forward for the successful uptake of water safety planning in Ukraine.

This national consultation reviewed and agreed on strategic steps needed to support the sustainable and effective deployment of water safety plans in Ukraine, and identified future support needs from WHO and other international partners. It will be a key step towards developing a tailored roadmap for implementing the Water Safety Planning programme in Ukraine. This roadmap would support accelerated progress towards aligning Ukraine’s national drinking water quality management with the requirements of the European Union Drinking Water Directive.
