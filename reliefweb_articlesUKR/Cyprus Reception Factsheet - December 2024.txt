Cyprus Reception Factsheet - December 2024

The Republic of Cyprus (RoC) is one of Europe’s frontline states. From 2015-2023 it was faced with increasing trends of mixed migration arrivals. The number of new asylum applications saw a sharp decrease in 2024, as compared with the trends over the last three years. In 2024, some 6,777 new asylum applications were made.

From 2002 until the end of 2024, some 23,300 persons have been granted international protection in the RoC, of whom approximately 4,600 have been granted refugee status, and 18,700 are subsidiary protection beneficiaries.

Up until the end of December 2024, some 24,341 refugees from Ukraine have applied for Temporary Protection in the RoC.

Asylum Processing

Asylum examination procedures take up to three years on average, exacerbating the difficulties already faced by asylum-seekers. As at the end of December 2024, approximately 20,500 persons’ applications are pending at the Asylum Service and 6,900 persons’ appeals are pending at the International Protection Administrative Court (IPAC).

UNHCR advocates for fair, fast and effective procedures for examining asylum applications, preserving the asylum system for those in need of international protection.
