**Overview**

The ongoing conflict continues. In February, intensified attacks severely damaged the following cities: Kyiv, Kherson, Sumy, Poltava, Chornobyl, Odesa, Kharkiv, and Mykolaiv, along with critical infrastructure. Multiple strikes on gas facilities in Poltava, Kharkiv, and Odesa disrupted energy supplies, causing power restrictions and increased reliance on imports.

On 14 February, a drone struck the safe confinement structure covering the reactor at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, which was installed following the 1986 disaster. The attack caused substantial damage to the protective shelter, raising the risk of increased radiation levels in the surrounding area.

On 16 February, a massive air attack targeted Kyiv and neighboring areas with more than 140 drones and ballistic missiles. The attacks caused damages, including infrastructure facilities.

From 18 to 20 February, drone and missile strikes hit Odesa, damaging port infrastructure, private buildings and clinics. The outcome was widespread power and heating outages, leaving thousands of residents without essential services, including connectivity in freezing winter conditions.
