Global Protection Cluster - The Four Areas of Responsibility, March 2025 [EN/UK]

Protection Clusters work on a range of protection activities. There are four specialized areas of focus— Gender-Based Violence, Child Protection, Mine Action and Housing, Land and Property. These specialized areas of focus are termed as the “Areas of Responsibility” or AoRs.

UNHCR is the Global Cluster Lead Agency for Protection. In this capacity UNHCR has the responsibility to lead and coordinate other United Nations agencies, inter-governmental organisations and non-governmental organisations participating in the GPC. In light of their thematic expertise, other agencies have been designated as focal point agencies for specific Areas of Responsibility (AoRs).
