Global Report on Law and Policy on Internal Displacement: Implementing National Responsibility

This report presents an overview – global and by region - of key law and policy developments related to prevention, protection and solutions for IDPs that occurred since the publication of the first [Global Report on Law and Policy on Internal Displacement](https://globalprotectioncluster.org/publications/810/reports/report/global-report-law-and-policy-internal-displacement-implementing), also reflected in [UNHCR’s IDP Law and Policy Dashboard](https://rimap.unhcr.org/idp-law-policy-dashboard).

The report then delves more deeply into the implementation of existing frameworks. Drawing evidence from 15 countries addressing displacement (Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Central African Republic, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Georgia, Honduras, Iraq, Mexico, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, Ukraine and Yemen), the research reviews the legal, policy and institutional response by affected States in order to identify challenges, lessons learnt, good practices and opportunities to strengthen implementation and ensure enjoyment of rights.
