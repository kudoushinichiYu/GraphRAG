Three years of loss and fear: War in Ukraine shatters children’s lives

Save the Children's extensive research, assessments, and programming in Ukraine throughout 2024, including a recent multi-sectoral needs assessment in the seven most affected regions, show the devastating and long-term consequences of the war on children. Beyond the destruction of homes and schools and the pain of family separation, children are facing an even deeper loss—the loss of stability, identity, and the fundamental foundations of a secure future.

The people, communities, and local civil society actors in Ukraine continue to be resilient in the face of the war’s severe effects and enormous obstacles. This resilience can be turned into recovery, and with the right support, communities can overcome the long-term effects of the war, avert the loss of an entire generation, and help children to reclaim their futures by ensuring access to vital resources, investing in resilience and coping mechanisms, and placing a high priority on mental health, education, and protection.
