**SITUATION UPDATE**

As Ukraine commemorated the third anniversary of the full-scale war, the security situation continued to deteriorate, with daily nationwide drone attacks utilizing advanced technology becoming commonplace. Ground operations in Eastern Ukraine have significantly slowed, with minimal territorial changes reported in recent weeks. Due to the worsening security conditions, WFP has lost operational access to Pokrovsk (11,000 food-insecure people) and eight villages of the Kostiantynivka community (nearly 1,200 food-insecure people) in the Donetsk region.
