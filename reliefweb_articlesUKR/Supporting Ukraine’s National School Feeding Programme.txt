Supporting Ukraineâ€™s National School Feeding Programme

**WFP WORKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE DAILY MEALS TO CHILDREN AND SUPPORT SCHOOLS**

The destruction of school buildings, attacks on energy infrastructure, and constrained state budgets have reduced the funding available for school meals. Many schools rely on contributions from parents to fund daily meals, but many families, particularly those who are displaced and unemployed, are struggling to cover school expenses during the war. Since 2023, WFP has been working with the Government and local authorities to help implement the National School Nutrition Reform, initiated by the First Lady, which aims to provide every child with daily nutritious meals.
