Legal Aid Bulletin for January 2025 [EN/UK]

*The Protection Cluster’s Legal Aid Working Group has identified key legal issues and updates for January 2025, based on analyzing member-provided data and open-source information.*

**Housing, Land and Property Issues**

**1. Housing certificate restrictions for owners of destroyed property acquired via lifetime care agreements:** Current legislation prevents owners of destroyed housing, acquired through a lifetime care agreement, from obtaining a housing certificate. A lifetime care agreement is a type of property transfer contract in which one party (the alienator) conveys ownership of valuable immovable or movable property to another party (the acquirer), in exchange for a commitment by the acquirer to provide lifetime care to the alienator. Those concerned cannot terminate ownership rights or purchase new property due to existing restrictions on property alienation under such agreements.

**2. Challenges in registering housing ownership due to archive destruction:** The destruction of the Bureau of Technical Inventory (BTI) archives in Dvorichna and Kupiansk Hromadas (Kharkiv Oblast) has left homeowners without official property records. This renders those concerned who are without registration in the State Register of Property Rights (SRPR), operational only since 2013, ineligible for housing compensation. The Chervonozavodskyi Raion Court of Kharkiv City, which handles these cases, has rejected related claims. Legislative amendments are needed to safeguard affected property owners.

**3. Compensation for damaged or destroyed housing to relatives of missing owners:** In Mykolaiv Oblast, the wife of a serviceman who went missing contacted a Protection Cluster partner. Since the ownership of the damaged real estate is registered in her husband’s name, she cannot receive compensation as she is not the legal owner. Despite the legal amendments introduced by Law No 4174-IX (see para. 4 below), in such situations, no procedures apart from court procedures are available to adjust ownership to access compensation.

**4. Improved procedures for establishing custody of missing persons' property:** The Law of Ukraine No. 4174-IX, enacted on 19 December 2024, enhances the process for establishing guardianship over the property of individuals recognized as missing or missing under special circumstances. Key changes include:

- Only one guardian can be appointed over the property of a missing person.
- Notaries will gain access to the Register of Missing Persons within three months.
- Notaries can search for and enter information about missing persons.
- A differentiated approach to territoriality, depending on the last known residence or location of property.
- No mandatory requirement for notaries to visit properties to describe them.
