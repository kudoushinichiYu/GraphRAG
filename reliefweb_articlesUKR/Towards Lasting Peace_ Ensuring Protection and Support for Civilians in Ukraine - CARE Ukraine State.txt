Towards Lasting Peace: Ensuring Protection and Support for Civilians in Ukraine - CARE Ukraine Statement

Ahead of the talks in Saudi Arabia, CARE сalls to put efforts to reduce civilian suffering and every step that leads toward a lasting peace. It is impossible to address the full scale of humanitarian needs during a limited ceasefire, even though it provides a vital opportunity to deliver an increase in urgently needed assistance, restore essential services, and support those most affected by the ongoing conflict. “When you see families forced to flee for the second or third time, you realize that securing critical infrastructure is only part of the equation. We call for comprehensive solutions that protect people and put their lives at the center,” - emphasizes Daria Chekalova, CARE Ukraine Advocacy Advisor.

Diplomatic efforts must continue to secure lasting peace. This can only be achieved through an inclusive process that ensures the voices of communities and groups across Ukraine are heard. "Ensuring a just and lasting peace means deliberately creating space for civil society leaders – including women-led and women’s rights organizations that represent the interests of diverse and vulnerable groups – to participate safely, directly, and meaningfully in all aspects of peace negotiations," – says Anzhelika Bielova, President of “Voice of Romni”, a CARE partner organization.

CARE remains committed to supporting people in need in Ukraine. This includes working with local partner organizations to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches those most in need, as well as assisting in the transition to recovery and reconstruction. We call on all parties to work on a comprehensive ceasefire and engage in efforts to secure lasting peace. Women have played critical roles as first responders during this war. Let's make sure they can be leaders in building sustainable peace.
