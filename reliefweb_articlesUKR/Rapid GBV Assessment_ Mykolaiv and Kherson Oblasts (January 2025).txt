An estimated 2.4 million vulnerable internally displaced people and nondisplaced war-affected people in Ukraine, predominantly women and girls, but also men and boys, are at risk of gender-based violence (GBV) and in need of immediate and continuous lifesaving GBV prevention, risk mitigation and response¹. Due to ongoing hostilities, frontline areas in Kherson suffer from intense shelling and destruction of residential infrastructure. Access to basic services, such as electricity, water supply, and medical care, remains limited. Internally displaced persons (IDPs), elderly individuals, and other vulnerable groups face difficulties in identifying safe accommodation. The region also continues to be heavily contaminated with mines and unexploded ordnance. Furthermore, women and female-headed households are particularly affected by economic instability due to limited employment opportunities. Mykolaiv oblast also continues to experience critical humanitarian needs. IDPs struggle with limited access to healthcare, food, and housing. Job opportunities are scarce due to the destruction of businesses and a lack of economic prospects, particularly for women and people with disabilities. The region has suffered significant destruction, while mines and unexploded ordnance continue to pose risks to civilians².
