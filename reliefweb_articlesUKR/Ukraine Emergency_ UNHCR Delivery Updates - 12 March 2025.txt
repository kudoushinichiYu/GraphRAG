Ukraine Emergency: UNHCR Delivery Updates - 12 March 2025

**OPERATIONAL CONTEXT & HIGHLIGHTS:**

- **Monday 24 February marked three years since the Russian Federation launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.** The UN Secretary-General issued a statement in which he reaffirmed the urgent need for a just, sustainable and comprehensive peace. Also marking the grim milestone, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi urged the world to remember Ukraineâ€™s displaced and war-affected people and called for continued support to Ukraine.
- **Largescale aerial attacks continued to impact civilians and civilian infrastructure across Ukraine.** The UN HRMMU reported that at least 123 civilians were killed and 567 injured in Ukraine in February 2025, with short-range drones causing the highest number of casualties. This constitutes a 35% increase compared with February 2024. In addition, attacks across the country on 7 March reportedly killed 21 civilians and injured many more, making it one of the deadliest days so far this year. Most of the casualties occurred in Donetska oblast, including in the town of Dobropillia, where a Russian attack killed 11 civilians and injured 47, including seven children.
- **Mandatory evacuations continue from areas of Donetska oblast, where intense hostilities are ongoing**. Civilians in frontline communities face increasingly harsh living conditions due to constant shelling and limited access to essential services. Many evacuees are extremely vulnerable, with a significant number of older and disabled people among those from areas under mandatory evacuation orders.
- **A new Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA4) was published in February** by the Government of Ukraine, the World Bank, EU and UN. It estimates that as of 31 December 2024, the total cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine will be $524 billion over the next decade. Direct damage in Ukraine has now reached $176 billion, an increase from $152 billion in the RDNA3 of February 2024.
- **UNHCR provides immediate protection and assistance** to war-affected people while **supporting early recovery and durable solutions** for displaced persons, returnees, and war-affected people remaining in their homes.
