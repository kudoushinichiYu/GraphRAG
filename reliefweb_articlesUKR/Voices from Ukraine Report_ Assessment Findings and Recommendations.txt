Voices from Ukraine Report: Assessment Findings and Recommendations

The ***Voices from Ukraine 2024*** Report offers an in-depth look at the experiences of women and girls affected by the ongoing war and at gender-based violence (GBV) in Ukraine. In 2024, the situation in Ukraine continued to deteriorate, with widespread insecurity and displacement throughout the country. As the number of persons in need continues to rise, women and girls and other marginalized groups find themselves even more vulnerable to risks of violence. Three years of war have eroded the coping capacities of women and girls, and GBV survivors face heightened barriers to access life-saving services and support.

***Voices from Ukraine*** 2024 gathers perspectives from women and girls in all their diversity across different regions of Ukraine. ***Voices from Ukraine*** is a qualitative research based on meaningful participatory consultation with women and girls, men and boys, other groups in communities, and GBV experts. The 2024 ***Voices*** Report, led by UNFPA in collaboration with the GBV Area of Responsibility (AoR) partners, marks the first year of this initiative in Ukraine.

The ***Voices*** Report provides an understanding of GBV trends in Ukraine and serves as a critical resource for evidence-based humanitarian programming, advocacy, and policy. ***Voices*** speaks to the resilience of women and girls in Ukraine, despite the growing challenges and risks they face in their daily lives. The report highlights the urgent need for targeted GBV programming, as well as GBV risk mitigation and inclusive and adapted approaches across the humanitarian response. These efforts are essential to addressing the needs of women and girls in Ukraine and supporting their safety, well-being, and participation.
