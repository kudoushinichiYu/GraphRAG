Ukrainian teachers help close education gap in Poland through training and employment programs

The war in Ukraine in 2022 forced millions of people to flee their homes, and around [150,000 new Ukrainian students](https://www.nik.gov.pl/en/news/foreigners-children-in-polish-schools.html) to enroll in Polish schools. This created an urgent need for teachers, while leaving thousands of highly qualified Ukrainian refugees underemployed.

"Of the 1300 children in our school, about 10 percent are foreigners. About 100 of them are Ukrainian," said Małgorzata Antonowicz, headmistress of primary school no. 340 in Warsaw.

By 2024, 65% of Ukrainian refugees had found jobs. However, many [remained in positions below their level of qualifications](https://pie.net.pl/en/65-ukrainian-refugees-work-but-face-many-challenges-in-the-polish-labour-market/) due to language barriers and difficulties in getting their degrees recognized. Despite [contributing between 0.7-1.1% of Poland's GDP](https://data.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/106993?) in 2023, systemic barriers continue to limit their access to professional employment. At the same time, Polish schools are facing a serious shortage of teachers.

"Especially at the level of primary and secondary schools, we have a gap because we do not have enough teachers," said Łukasz Sułkowski, Professor of Economic Sciences, Jagiellonian University and president of the board of PCG Poland, a global consulting firm. "Some of the students from Ukraine will stay here for a longer time. And we need the support of qualified psychologists and teachers, also from Ukraine, to make things smoother," he added.

**Bridging the gap**

In response to the refugee crisis, CARE returned to Poland in 2022 (it first worked there in the immediate aftermath of World War II, in the 1940s) and launched a cash-for-work program to provide immediate employment for Ukrainian teachers. Over 18 months, this initiative helped stabilize schools facing teacher shortages while providing financial support for refugee educators. However, the reliance on external funding made it clear that a more durable solution was needed. As a result, CARE transitioned from temporary salary support to skills training and a qualifications recognition initiative. This initiative was implemented in partnership with the Polish Center for International Aid (PCPM) and the Unbreakable Ukraine Foundation (UUF), with funding from Mosakowski Family Foundation.

To be able to work in Polish schools, people from outside of the European Union often have to undergo a process called “nostrification,” which Polish law defines it as “[an official procedure which is conducted to determine the Polish equivalent of a foreign diploma](https://study.gov.pl/nostrification-higher-education-diplomas)”. Nostrification is carried out if a diploma, which confirms completion of higher education studies abroad, is not recognized as equivalent to a relevant Polish diploma or professional certification under any international agreement.

CARE’s initiative in collaboration with PCPM and UUF supports diploma recognition and nostrification as well as Polish language courses, and postgraduate courses. These services enable teachers to secure independent employment in Polish schools, reducing long-term dependence on external funding while addressing the teacher shortage in a more sustainable way.

"I have encountered a lot of legal barriers here. It takes so much time and money. Nostrification alone costs more than $1,000. And it is extremely difficult to do everything on your own," said Hanna Vepretska, an individual supported by this program who found a job teaching English in one of the Warsaw schools.

”The initiative's success is evident in its substantial cost savings, with a notable 84% reduction in direct costs per beneficiary. This achievement underscores the efficacy of our skills development strategy, which is meticulously designed to deliver immediate cost efficiencies while ensuring long-term durable solutions," stated Piotr Sasin, country director at CARE Poland. "Beyond addressing the pressing challenges faced by Ukrainian teachers, this initiative supports their seamless integration into the Polish education system. This strategic initiative not only enhances the quality of education but also fosters stronger professional partnerships, reflecting our unwavering dedication to implementing impactful, forward-thinking solutions."

By dedicating resources to professional recognition and credential validation, the initiative facilitated a more effective and sustainable integration of Ukrainian teachers into the Polish education system.

"We have been nostrifying diplomas for years. In 2019 there was one Ukrainian diploma \[in Poland\], in 2021 there were seven, in 2023 and 2024 there were over 380 diplomas, 311 as part of this project," said Katarzyna Trynda, PhD, the vice-rector of the University of Silesia in Katowice.

**Impact of the project**

Project evaluation data showed that 87.5% of school directors expressed satisfaction with the qualifications and professionalism of Ukrainian staff. In addition, 93.8% of respondents confirmed that Ukrainian staff help alleviate the challenges associated with the increased number of foreign students, underscoring their crucial role in school integration. In addition, the presence of Ukrainian teachers has contributed to an overall improvement in school dynamics. Survey results indicate that 71.9% of respondents observed a significant positive impact on the overall school atmosphere, while 65.6% reported that Ukrainian staff increased Polish students' understanding and acceptance of Ukrainian culture.

Parents also shared their perspectives on the inclusion of Ukrainian staff, with 89.3% of Ukrainian parents expressing satisfaction with their presence, underscoring the critical role these educators play in helping students adjust to academic and emotional challenges.

"We are satisfied. My child feels positive results. My son is happy with his studies and the fact that he has time to relax and spend time with his peers," said one of the parents. In addition, 60.2% of Ukrainian parents noted an improvement in communication with schools after the arrival of Ukrainian staff, underscoring the impact of these educators.

CARE Poland's model illustrates the potential of investing in refugee skills development as a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to subsidizing salaries. By prioritizing skills training and professional recognition of qualification from the country of origin, the initiative empowers refugees to integrate independently, thereby reducing long-term dependency on humanitarian assistance. This project in its phase one, implemented by CARE, PCPM, UUF and funded by the Mosakowski Family Foundation supported 1,050 individuals in accreditation of their diplomas in Poland, Language courses and postgraduate studies. So far nearly 800 were employed in Polish schools.

Despite the progress made, challenges remain. While many Ukrainian teachers have found employment, underemployment among this and other regulated professions remains a problem. As of 2025, there are over 20 000 teaching vacancies in Polish schools and according to CARE at least 4,500 Ukrainian refugees who are qualified teachers. Language skills and recognition of credentials continue to limit access to positions that fully match their expertise. Addressing these challenges will require further investment in professional licensing, targeted language support, and policy reforms to streamline mutual recognition of foreign credentials. As European countries continue to explore solutions for refugee employment, this program offers a proven model that balances economic efficiency with social cohesion. Strategic investments in training and credential recognition can benefit both displaced professionals and host communities. Furthermore, retaining professional skills among refugee populations and upskilling are critical for future human capital recovery and Ukraine’s integration into the EU markets.
