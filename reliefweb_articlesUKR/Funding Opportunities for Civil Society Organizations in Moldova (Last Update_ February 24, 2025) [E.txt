Funding Opportunities for Civil Society Organizations in Moldova (Last Update: February 24, 2025) [EN/RO]

This compilation is part of the Refugee Coordination Forum's effort to support local organizations in Moldova to access funding opportunities in line with localization efforts. We have collected information from various sources online and compiled it here for the convenience of local CSOs. However, it is important to note that the RCF is not responsible for these opportunities, nor does it take part in any decision related to them, nor can it recommend organizations for them. If you have any other funding opportunities to contribute or want to share feedback, please write to us (mdachrcf@unhcr.org).
