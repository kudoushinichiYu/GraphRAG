Quarterly Social Listening Report (from October to December 2024)

This report presents an analysis of refugee and local community social media posts or threads shared via online social media sources.  

Between October and December 2024, the InfoUnit collected 3,064 posts or threads, monitored over 124,351 posts, posted 58 informative updates covering topics like temporary protection, medical services, cash assistance, and legal issues, addressed 2.408 questions, and shared information about over 383 free events, training sessions, courses accessible to both refugee and host communities, and others.  

Rumors and information spread quickly among the communities and can have serious consequences. Tracking social media enables humanitarian organizations and various stakeholders to stay informed about community discussions and tackle any misinformation that may arise.  

Information monitoring also helps identify gaps or deficiencies in the humanitarian response.  

In this report, the term "Refugees" applies to individuals displaced from Ukraine â€” including those seeking protection in Moldova, temporary protection, asylum seekers, refugee status, or others.  

This report is part of the Accountability to Affected People (AAP) mechanisms of the Refugee Coordination Forum (RCF) in Moldova.
