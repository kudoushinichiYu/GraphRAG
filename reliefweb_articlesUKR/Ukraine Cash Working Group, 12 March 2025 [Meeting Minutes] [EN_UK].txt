The Survey circulated by the CWG with 18 responses received. Global OCHA Survey to be launched this week in Ukraine, one response per organization expected. CWG members request to have a better understanding on how this situation is affecting some of the big UN agencies and INGOs that did not contribute to the report, maybe by bilateral engagement.
