Slovakia: RRP Activity and Funding report - guidelines for partners - March 2025

**1. PROGRESS REPORT**

To ensure that the humanitarian assistance is coordinated in a coherent and complementary way amongst the different humanitarian actors, within the framework of the Refugee Response Plan (RRP) lead by UNHCR, it is key to monitor the response and funding progress of the activities implemented by humanitarian actors. This is essential to all humanitarian actors to coordinate activities effectively, monitor targets to be achieved on time, ensure that humanitarian needs are met without gaps or duplications.  
Each partner has submitted their project proposals with two types of information to the RRP 2025/26 for Slovakia: planned activities and targets, and financial requirements. This information expressed the objectives of your organizations and what you are planning to achieve (targets), as well as the financial needs to achieve these goals.  
Reporting will therefore also focus on both dimensions: on the achievement of your targets, meaning how many people have been reached, as well as how many funds have been received, have the financial needs been covered or do any major gaps exist. This reporting serves the following goals:

• Accountability, towards the population assisted, the public and governments 

• Coordination at intersectoral and sector level, including identification of gaps in response 

• For each agency/organization, who may use the data to better cooperate with other agencies in their areas of intervention 

The purpose of this document is to provide guidance and ensure a common understanding among RRP partners and other humanitarian actors in Slovakia, on RRP reporting; reporting system, framework, related indicators to support harmonized programming, project development, correct data collection and subsequent reporting against the corresponding standardized indicators.  
To ensure the correct implementation of this process, partners working under the RRP 2025/26, are accountable to report on all indicators set in Slovakia relevant to their project; agreed within the sectors using the corresponding platform (Activity info). The partners are responsible to report before the scheduled deadline on the achievements of the previous period as per the reporting deadlines set (Section 4 of this document: Reporting Schedule).  
As part of the RRP 2025/26, partners should take care of their roles and responsibilities, also in reporting:

• The Reporting Operational UN agencies and NGOs (herein: partners) working under the RRP, are accountable to report on all indicators set at country; relevant to their project; agreed within the sectors on Activity Info platform.

• The partners are responsible to report before the scheduled deadline on the achievements of the previous month as per the reporting deadlines set by the Inter-Agency at country level.

• The partners are accountable to report on indicators based on the definition of each indicator that was agreed on within each sector.

• The partners could be contacted by the relevant Information Management focal points at country level for correction of data or additional clarification.

• Unless necessary, partners shall not be requested to fill any 3W/4W/5W matrix in parallel to Activity Info reporting.

• Reporting on Activity-Info does not release partners from submitting requirements to funding agency such as quarterly reporting and others.
