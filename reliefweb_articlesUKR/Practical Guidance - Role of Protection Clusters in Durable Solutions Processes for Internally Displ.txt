Practical Guidance - Role of Protection Clusters in Durable Solutions Processes for Internally Displaced Persons

**Introduction**

**Main Goal**

The primary goal of this guidance is to define the role of the Protection Cluster and its Areas of Responsibility (AoRs) in durable solutions processes to ensure that protection remains central to solutions planning and programming.

**Target Audience**

This guidance is intended for Protection Cluster and AoR Coordinators, and Protection Cluster members, where applicable.

**Specific Objectives**

Equip Protection Clusters with practical entry points to engage in durable solutions processes from the onset of displacement crises, ensuring a smooth transition toward sustainable solutions for and with displacement-affected communities. Strategically leverage existing protection data, analysis, advocacy, and partnerships to anchor solutions processes in protection standards and principles.

**Key Messages**

• Durable solutions are fundamentally about restoring rights and, therefore, represent the ultimate protection outcome. IDPs cannot achieve durable solutions if they are not protected.

• Solutions initiatives must be inclusive - they must not leave segments of the population further behind or create new protection risks. Many protection interventions can also be aligned with progressive solutions-oriented approaches.

• Durable solutions must be embedded from the onset of displacement crises, with humanitarian actors, especially protection actors, playing a crucial role in laying the groundwork for solutions.

• Protection actors have a key role in ensuring protection, participation, and agency of people affected by displacement remain at the centre of solutions processes.

• Humanitarian actors, including Protection Clusters, should not create parallel systems. Instead, they should support national and local authorities in ensuring IDPs have access to national or local services. These systems should be strengthened and improved to benefit both newly arrived displaced persons and host communities.
