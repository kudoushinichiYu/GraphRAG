Three years of medical evacuation of Ukrainian patients

Ever since Russia started its full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, Norway has contributed to the medical evacuation of Ukrainian patients. In total, Norway has transported around 2,250 patients to Norway and other European countries for medical treatment.

‘Norway has been a significant contributor to civilian assistance to Ukraine. Medical evacuation is important to relieve the pressure on the health services in the country. Norway's efforts are helping to save lives and provide necessary health care to Ukrainian patients,’ said Minister of Health and Care Services Jan Christian Vestre.

**Relieves the health service**

A total of 452 patients and 257 relatives have arrived in Norway during this period. Since August 2022, Norway has collaborated with the EU on regular evacuation flights of Ukrainian patients through the European Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM). The evacuations are carried out by the air evacuation group of the Norwegian Armed Forces Medical Corps and SAS in close cooperation with Norwegian health authorities, the Directorate for Civil Protection and other actors.

‘Hospitals and clinics are affected by the Russian attacks. The Ukrainian health service is under severe pressure. Many countries have capacity for hospital treatment, but not suitable transportation options for medical evacuation. Our air transport helps to utilize the hospital capacity that exists in many countries to relieve the health service in Ukraine,’ said Minister of Foreign Affairs Espen Barth Eide.

**Comprehensive contribution**

In addition to medical evacuation, Norway has contributed significant amounts of medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and other materials.

‘Norway's contribution to Ukraine is extensive and varied. We have delivered everything from medical equipment to personal protective equipment. This shows our ability to mobilize quickly and efficiently. The government will continue to support the Ukrainian people as long as it is needed,’ said Barth Eide.

## **Institutional health collaboration**

Since 2019, Norway has had an institutional health partnership with Ukraine. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH), Akershus University Hospital, the Eastern Norwegian Regional Resource Center on Violence, Traumatic Stress and Suicide Prevention and Sunnaas Hospital collaborate with Ukrainian partners on issues such as antimicrobial resistance, mental health and physical rehabilitation. The aim has been to strengthen capacity in public health through strategic and professional institutional collaboration.

Through the Nansen Program for Ukraine, Norway and Ukraine have entered into a new agreement on health cooperation. The agreement is a continuation of the cooperation Norway has had with Ukraine since 2019. The amount of the agreement is NOK 53.3 million for the period October 2024 to December 2027.

‘The aim of the new agreement is to reduce the negative effects of the war on the health system. The cooperation project is in line with the Ukrainian authorities' health strategy and priorities,’ said Minister of Health and Care Services Jan Christian Vestre.
