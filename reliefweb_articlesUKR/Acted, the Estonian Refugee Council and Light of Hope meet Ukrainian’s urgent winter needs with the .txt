Acted, the Estonian Refugee Council and Light of Hope meet Ukrainian’s urgent winter needs with the support of the EU

As temperatures in Ukraine drop below -10 °C, Acted, the Estonian Refugee Council (ERC) and local partner Light of Hope, remain committed to meeting the urgent winterisation needs of severely war-affected communities with the support of European Union Humanitarian Aid. Through Cash for Heating program, and in-kind assistance including solid fuel, winter kits and rapid thermal kits, Acted and ERC respond flexibly to winter needs, ensuring the safety, dignity and warmth of conflict-affected households.

*"Keeping homes warm is not just about comfort—it’s about survival. As Ukraine faces another harsh winter under relentless attacks, the EU remains committed to helping people heat their homes. Our support will continue, for as long as Ukrainians need it."* Marianna Franco, Head of the EU Humanitarian Aid in Ukraine

In severely war-affected areas of Ukraine, winterisation support remains a critical lifeline to ensure the safety, dignity and well-being of the most vulnerable, especially the elderly and persons with disabilities. As of February 2025, more than 3,900 households have benefitted from Cash for Heating delivered by Acted and ERC, with the support of EU Humanitarian Aid. In parallel, more than 1,300 households in frontline areas with limited market functionality have benefitted from in-kind winterisation support. In line with the localisation agenda in the Ukraine humanitarian response, Acted remains committed to supporting the role of local CSOs in delivering vital assistance. In this project, this has included the distribution of solid fuel to 134 households by Light of Hope in Izium raion of Kharkiv oblast.

*Thanks to our partners, the team of the "Light of Hope" was able to provide firewood to 148 households in the Izium district of Kharkiv region. This assistance is extremely important for ensuring warmth and comfort in people's homes during the cold season.*

"*We are sincerely grateful to our partners for their solidarity and support, which helps the community members who live in difficult and dangerous conditions. Their help contributes to strengthening human dignity and facilitates access to essential resources.*

*At this challenging time, when many civilians have lost their homes and livelihoods, the support of partners like Acted and EU Humanitarian Aid is extremely important. It helps ensure the provision of humanitarian aid to those who find themselves in the most vulnerable situations. This kind of assistance allows people to meet their most urgent needs."* Light of Hope

While the winter in Ukraine is approaching its end, temperatures in February have dropped substantially, while power outages continue to impact the country, underscoring the necessity of winterisation assistance for the most vulnerable. Acted, ERC and local partners will continue to deliver assistance to the most vulnerable, with an emphasis on rural and isolated communities.
