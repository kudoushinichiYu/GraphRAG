Project HOPE and Switzerland Launch Phase II of Healthcare Support Initiative in Ukraine

Project HOPE, in partnership with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), has launched the second phase of a program to expand healthcare access for vulnerable communities in Ukraine. With a contribution from SDC, this initiative will focus on war-affected communities across seven regions of Ukraine, including Kherson, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Donetsk and will run through the end of October 2026.

The project is projected to reach a minimum of 160,000 people, provide 570,000 patient consultations, and support 50 healthcare facilities.

The key activities of the collaboration will include:

– **Mobile Medical Units (MMUs)**: deploying 10 **MMUs** to provide health services to populations with limited or no access to medical care in hard-to-reach areas.

– **Surge Staffing:** supporting and incentivizing 25 health workers**,** including doctors, nurses, and mental health professionals to address staff shortages.

– **Medical Supplies & Equipment:** providing essential medications and medical equipment to 50 healthcare facilities.

– **Capacity Building:** training health workers in mental health support and emergency care.

– **Infrastructure and Energy Efficiency:** improving infrastructure and energy efficiency in healthcare facilities.

– **Community Campaigns:** promoting health awareness through community campaigns.

With SDC’s support, Project HOPE continues its mission to provide life-saving healthcare and strengthen resiliency in Ukraine’s war-affected regions.

“We are excited to continue our collaboration with Switzerland to ensure critical access to healthcare for those in need. Together, we are making a tangible impact in strengthening Ukraine’s health system and saving lives,” said Ilya Gabrichidze, Project HOPE’s Program Specialist in Ukraine.

“Supporting the resilience of Ukraine’s health system during the war remains a priority. Our partnership with Project HOPE helps expand access to essential medical and protection services for vulnerable Ukrainians in the areas where these needs are most acute,” said Oleg Masyk, SDC National Programme Officer.

**About the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation:** The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation has been present in Ukraine since the 1990s. Before the onset of Russia’s military aggression in February 2022, Switzerland was the fifth-largest bilateral donor to Ukraine, providing over USD 250 million from 2014 to 2021. Since February 2022, Switzerland has rapidly mobilized additional funds to support Ukraine, based on the enormous needs in healthcare, food security, protection of victims and their rights, holistic health care and water supply and sanitation. As one of the few countries, Switzerland is directly active close to the frontlines in Ukraine, assessing the evolving humanitarian needs, delivering relief supplies and supporting projects in the health, protection, livelihood and shelter sectors, as well as directly implementing projects in water supply, sanitation, and hygiene.
