Bosnia and Herzegovina Fact Sheet - February 2025

UNHCR works with authorities and civil society to improve the early identification of those with protection needs and to strengthen asylum procedures.

The operational footprint of UNHCR in BiH has progressively reduced, shifting focus on core mandate activities related to asylum, inclusion and statelessness, and expanding advocacy efforts.

Together with authorities and NGO partners, UNHCR works to resolve all known cases of statelessness and to prevent new cases from arising.
