Ukraine - Fourth Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA4): February 2022 - December 2024

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Since February 24, 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused civilian casualties and hardship, damage to infrastructure and productive assets, and disruption to the economy. As of December 2024, an estimated 6.2 million people were recorded as refugees across Europe,2 while 4,642,735 people were officially registered as internally displaced persons (IDPs) by the Ministry of Social Policy (MoSP). Over 12,456 people have been killed, more than 28,000 have been injured, and millions have lost their homes.3 In addition, poverty has increased: the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine4 has reported that poverty rates (based on the actual subsistence minimum poverty line) rose 1.7 times between 2021 and 2023—that is, from 20.6 percent to 35.5 percent.5 According to the United Nations (UN), some 15 percent of the population, or nearly 5 million people, is estimated to be food insecure as of January 2025.6 As documented in previous Rapid Damage and Needs Assessments (RDNAs), the impacts of the invasion are uneven, and the greatest effects are felt by those citizens mobilized to fight, women, persons with disabilities, children and youth, IDPs, and older persons. Job and income loss continue, as well as persistently high inflation, affecting purchasing power and causing loss of assets among Ukrainians, particularly the most vulnerable, with a range of human impacts across different sectors. The estimated gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024 was 78 percent of 2021 GDP in real terms, up from 74 percent in 2023. Overall, setbacks in the country’s development and in its progress toward many of the Sustainable Development Goals continue to accumulate.

The war intensity has shifted across regions, while active hostilities have remained concentrated in the eastern parts of Ukraine (Figure 1). Within three months of the invasion, direct damage reached US$97 billion.7 During the latter half of 2022, the Government of Ukraine (GoU) regained control across several areas, which checked the rapid escalation in damage. However, attacks on critical infrastructure in fall and winter 2022 contributed to damage that reached US$135 billion by February 2023.8 Regular attacks on infrastructure continued throughout 2023, with attacks across battle zones as well as in a number of regions and cities. The destruction of the Kakhovka Dam and hydroelectric power plant in June 2023 resulted in incalculable impacts to the environment and exacerbated challenges already faced by people struggling to access housing, water, food, and health services, among others.9 By the end of 2023, total direct damage was estimated at US$152 billion (see Box 1).10 During 2024, hostilities escalated significantly in several regions, including in the Donetska region, and air attacks intensified throughout Ukraine, damaging urban areas and strategic energy, transport, and other infrastructure facilities
