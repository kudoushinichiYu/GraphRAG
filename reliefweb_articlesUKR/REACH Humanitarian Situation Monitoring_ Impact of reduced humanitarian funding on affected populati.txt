REACH Humanitarian Situation Monitoring: Impact of reduced humanitarian funding on affected populations, February 2025 | Ukraine [EN/UK]

**Key Messages**

• The prevalence and severity of humanitarian needs across settlements, as measured by the Settlement Vulnerability Index (SVI) (see Endnote 5), has not changed dramatically from December to February, suggesting it may take more time to see the effects of reduced humanitarian funding.

• Direct reports by KIs on reductions in levels of assistance received from December to February remained limited to a few settlements (8%). However, trend analysis suggests a more severe impact (particularly in hygiene and food assistance), mainly in settlements further from the frontline. Reduction in certain types of assistance may be underestimated due to key informants’ limited knowledge.

• If these findings are indicative of the impact a continued reduction in humanitarian funding may have, vulnerable people further away from the frontline may be at risk of being underserved. With constrained resources, humanitarian organisations may have already recentred their support to frontline areas, where needs are more acute.
