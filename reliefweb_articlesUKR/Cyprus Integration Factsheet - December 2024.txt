Cyprus Integration Factsheet - December 2024

Over the years, the Republic of Cyprus (RoC) has been receiving an increasing number of refugees, particularly from neighbouring Syria. From 2002 until the end of 2024, some 23,300 persons have been registered as having been granted international protection in Cyprus, of whom approximately 4,600 were granted refugee status, and approximately 18,700 subsidiary protection. With significant numbers of people afforded international protection in the RoC in recent years, the need for greater assistance and support to help them integrate has become more apparent.

In 2023 some 11,617 persons applied for asylum in the RoC. In 2024, some 6,777 persons applied for asylum. Approximately 20,500 persons’ applications are pending at the Asylum Service and 6,900 persons’ appeals are pending at the International Protection Administrative Court (IPAC), as at end of December 2024.

Up the until end of December 2024, some 24,341 refugees from Ukraine have applied for Temporary Protection in the RoC.
