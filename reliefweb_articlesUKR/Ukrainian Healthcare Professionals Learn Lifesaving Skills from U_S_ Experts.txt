**Kyiv, Ukraine – March 21, 2025** – MedGlobal recently provided a hands-on training program on Basic Life Support (BLS), Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS), and Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) to **55 Ukrainian healthcare professionals**. The training, held from **March 15-20, 2025**, at Shupyk National Healthcare University of Ukraine in Kyiv, featured advanced emergency care skills that will enhance patient outcomes in critical situations in hospital and community settings.
