Ukraine: Humanitarian Response and Funding Snapshot and Year-End 2024 Analysis (January - December 2024) [EN/UK]

**In 2024, over 660 humanitarian organizations assisted** [**8.4 million people**](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZjMxMDI1MzMtZGY3Ni00NzU5LThkNDgtODIyNjdkZGMzMmZiIiwidCI6IjBmOWUzNWRiLTU0NGYtNGY2MC1iZGNjLTVlYTQxNmU2ZGM3MCIsImMiOjh9) **across Ukraine under the** [2024 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan (HNRP)](https://humanitarianaction.info/plan/1177). Humanitarians reached 99 per cent of the people planned for assistance with essential aid and services such as food, shelter, medical care, protection and child-focused interventions. As of the end of December, the 2024 HNRP was 73 per cent funded.

**Throughout the year, the humanitarian community, including the UN agencies and national and international NGOs, delivered life-saving aid to the people affected by the war in Ukraine in line with its strategic objectives for 2024.** Humanitarian workers focused on the hardest-hit front-line regions, where needs were higher. However, escalating violence and administrative barriers, such as military conscription, slowed down humanitarian response efforts to assist people mostly close to the front line. During the year, repeated attacks damaged or destroyed energy infrastructure and disrupted essential services like water, gas and heating during winter. Attacks also damaged homes, hospitals and schools. In the front-line regions of eastern, southern and north-eastern Ukraine, intensified violence shifted front lines and forced more people to flee. As a result, the government and humanitarian groups carried out continuous government-led evacuations, especially in Donetska, Kharkivska and Sumska oblasts. At the same time, humanitarian partners continued their regular aid programme wherever possible, ensuring that the people in need received at least some form of assistance.

**In 2024, humanitarian partners reported that at least 6.6 million people benefited from water system repairs and emergency water supplies**; nearly 3.2 million people received food assistance and livelihood support, and some 2.8 million people received vital medicines and health care, particularly in north-eastern, eastern and southern Ukraine. Approximately 2.1 million people received materials for emergency repairs to their damaged buildings, as well as other essential non-food supplies, amid ongoing hostilities and widespread destruction during the winter months. Over 1.7 million people received general protection assistance, including legal counselling and psychosocial support. Additionally, nearly 2 million children benefited from protection services, including mental health and psychosocial support, to reduce the risks worsened by the war. Along with in-kind assistance such as emergency food, medicine, clothing, shelter materials and other essential services, aid organizations provided nearly $690 million through cash and voucher assistance. More than 40 per cent of this amount went to [cash assistance](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNmZiYWRhNDYtZWJhZC00MTUyLWJiNzEtYTZlNzMzM2I3YzhhIiwidCI6IjBmOWUzNWRiLTU0NGYtNGY2MC1iZGNjLTVlYTQxNmU2ZGM3MCIsImMiOjh9&pageName=ReportSection), helping people meet basic needs while supporting the local economy. Approximately 750,000 people, comprising gender-based violence survivors and those at risk, benefited from specialized services.
