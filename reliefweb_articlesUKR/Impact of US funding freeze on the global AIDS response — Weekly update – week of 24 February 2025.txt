Impact of US funding freeze on the global AIDS response — Weekly update – week of 24 February 2025

Sixteen new reports on the impact of the freeze of US foreign assistance on the global AIDS response were received from UNAIDS’ Country Offices during the week of 17-21 February. As of 21 February, at least one status report had been received from 55 countries, including 42 PEPFAR-supported and 13 that receive some US support.

Reports received over the past week show that waivers have led to the resumption of select clinical services, such as HIV treatment and prevention of vertical transmission, in many countries that are highly dependent on US funding. However, the durability of this resumption is unclear amid multiple reports that key US government systems and staff responsible for paying implementing partners are either offline or working at greatly reduced capacity.

Critical layers of national AIDS responses are ineligible for waivers, including many HIV prevention and community-led services for key populations and adolescent girls and young women. In addition, data collection and analysis services have been disrupted in numerous countries. Reports from UNAIDS’ Country Offices note that these interruptions have eroded the overall quantity and quality of HIV prevention, testing and treatment services. Human resources for health at health facilities are facing increased workloads, and patients are experiencing increased waiting times to receive life-saving services. US government statements to UN system organizations suggest US-funded programmes focused on gender equality and transgender populations may not resume.
