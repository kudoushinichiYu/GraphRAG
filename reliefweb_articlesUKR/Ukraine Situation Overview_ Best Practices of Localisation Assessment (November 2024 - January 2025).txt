Ukraine Situation Overview: Best Practices of Localisation Assessment (November 2024 - January 2025) [EN/UK]

**INTRODUCTION**

This assessment aims to identify best practices in the localisation of humanitarian efforts, focusing on the coordination and capacitybuilding between international and local actors in Ukraine. By documenting successful examples of localisation and assessing the effectiveness of current capacity-building efforts, the report will highlight areas for improvement in equity, mutual respect, and shared decision-making. The assessment will explore gaps in localisation, challenges in partnerships, and mechanisms that can promote more equitable cooperation. The geographic focus includes local Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and International NGOs (INGOs) that operate in the West (Lviv), North (Kyiv), South (Odesa), and East (Kharkiv), ensuring a broad representation of Ukraineâ€™s regions. Ultimately, the goal is to provide actionable insights to enhance the role of local actors in the humanitarian response across the country.

**KEY FINDINGS**

**Partnerships:** Partnerships between INGOs and CSOs are crucial for effective localisation. However, challenges such as competition for resources and insufficient communication hinder the full potential of these partnerships.

**Capacity-Building:** CSOs value mentorship and training but need more tailored support in areas like management, security, and psychological well-being.

**Coordination:** Challenges in coordination remain, including inefficiencies in coordination efforts, bureaucratic hurdles, and a lack of communication strategies within CSOs,

**Policy Influence:** CSOs seek more participation in policy development, but face barriers such as limited access to relevant discussions and poor information-sharing.

**Equity and Accountability:** The majority of INGOs have feedback mechanisms, but some CSOs doubt their feedback is truly considered. Key barriers to localisation include bureaucratic challenges, competition for staff for CSOs and INGOs.
