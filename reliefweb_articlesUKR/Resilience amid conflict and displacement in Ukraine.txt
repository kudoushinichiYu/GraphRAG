Resilience amid conflict and displacement in Ukraine

Today marks three years since the conflict in Ukraine began. Over this time, many have endured immense suffering and loss. Yet despite these challenges, Dorcas Ukraine has seen the extraordinary resilience of our project participants, who continue to show unwavering strength.

## Meet Tetiana (60)

Tetiana and her husband Serhii lived in Pologi, a town occupied in 2022. After the occupation, they were evacuated to Zaporizhya. Tetiana recounts: ‘There was constant shelling and we ran out of food, money and medicine for Serhii, who had suffered a stroke. With no communication or electricity, we had to travel across the city just to charge our phones. We left everything behind, taking only our cats.’

Reflecting on the last few years, Tetiana shares: ‘We have endured much. Though we carry on with our daily lives, we’re constantly confronted with the cycle of mourning what we’ve lost, followed by healing and growing stronger. I’ve had to let go of the pain of losing our home, which is now occupied by others.’

## A new beginning in Zaporizhya

In Zaporizhya, Tetiana connected with Dorcas Ukraine through our ‘restoring hope’ project. Through this initiative, she enrolled in a sewing course, which has contributed to improving her family’s livelihood. Learning to sew had always been a dream of Tetiana, and despite the challenges, she was able to make it a reality.

Tetiana now plans to start by repairing clothes before moving on to tailoring. Together with her daughter, she also aims to create adaptive clothing for the wounded in hospitals.

At Dorcas, we remain committed to supporting people like Tetiana to rebuild their lives with dignity and hope. Her story is a reminder that even in the face of immense loss, new beginnings are possible.
