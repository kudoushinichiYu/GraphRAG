Basic Needs and Livelihoods Assessment in Near-Frontline Communities of Ukraine | An assessment of essential needs, service gaps, and livelihood challenges in rural and semi-urban communities near frontline areas of Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia

**Context**

As the conflict in Ukraine continues into 2025, the escalation of hostilities in has severely disrupted life in frontline and near-frontline areas, exacerbating humanitarian needs and straining essential services. According to the 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan (HNRP)**1**, an estimated 12.7 million people in Ukraine require humanitarian assistance, including nearly 2 million children, 2.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), and 9.9 million non-displaced individuals severely impacted by the war, including returnees. The greatest concentrations of those in need are in the eastern, northeastern, and southern oblasts.

As military operations intensify, regions such as Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts face acute shortages of basic necessities, worsening economic instability, and deteriorating infrastructure. In this evolving crisis, a comprehensive understanding of the needs of affected populations is critical to ensuring that humanitarian assistance remains responsive, targeted, and effective.

This needs assessment, conducted by the Joint Emergency Response in Ukraine (JERU)**2**, Angels of Salvation, Posmishka UA and The Relief Coordination Center (RCC) evaluates the primary challenges faced by key demographic groups in near-frontline and rural communities. It provides an evidence-based analysis of vulnerabilities, barriers to accessing essential services, and opportunities to enhance resilience. The findings will inform programmatic responses and refine assistance strategies to better meet the needs of impacted populations.
