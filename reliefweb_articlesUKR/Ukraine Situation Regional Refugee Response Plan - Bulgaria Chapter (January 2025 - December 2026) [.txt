Ukraine Situation Regional Refugee Response Plan - Bulgaria Chapter (January 2025 - December 2026) [EN/BG]

**Part 1: Current Situation Situation**

**Overview**

During 2024, the Government of Bulgaria has granted or renewed temporary protection to some 75,000 refugees. More than two-thirds are women and children. Bulgaria has seen a slight increase in temporary protection registration rates during the year, as compared to that of the previous year. Rapid protection monitoring during the summer months showed that most newly arriving refugees were from the most affected regions of southern and eastern Ukraine. 23F 24 The 2024 Socio-Economic Insights Survey (SEIS) findings24F 25 illustrate that most of the refugees interviewed have been present in Bulgaria for an average of 23 months,25F 26 indicating a stable population within the country who need continued meaningful inclusion within national systems and host communities. Despite holding two national parliamentary elections in 2024 – marking seven election cycles in three years – Bulgaria has yet to achieve a parliamentary majority to form a new government. In this context, the Government of Bulgaria has continued to extend the national humanitarian programme for refugees from Ukraine, currently until end 2024. The programme includes government-sponsored accommodation in state facilities and hotels, most of which are in the Burgas and Varna regions. The Government is developing a new humanitarian and integration programme, which has not yet concluded. In March 2024, the draft programme was presented to the Council of Ministers but not adopted due to the change of government. The 2025-26 RRP will continue to support the efforts of the Government to provide humanitarian services for all refugees in Bulgaria, advancing towards stronger localization and inclusion initiatives.
