Guide for risk management in the context of emergencies, armed conflict and crises. [EN/UK]

**Social media platforms have become crucial digital infrastructures for accessing and sharing information. And they play a key role in combating disinformation and hate speech in conflicts like the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.**

**Based on contextual analysis of the situation in Ukraine**

The intention of the Guide for Risk Management is to provide guidance and mitigation recommendations for social media platform companies. The guide offers a context-specific framework enabling social media platform companies to safeguard human rights in the Ukrainian information ecosystem, particularly freedom of speech and access to information, whilst placing a specific emphasis on groups such as women, minorities and marginalised groups that are commonly targeted.

This is interlinked with the second scope of the guide, which is to inspire action beyond Ukraine by outlining how the framework can be adapted to other countries affected by crisis, emergency, and armed conflict.

This guide is a living document which will be subject to change according to the contextual developments within and outside Ukraine.
